**Your website is too slow. I can tell you why.**

You could be leaving hundreds of thousands of dollars of revenue on the table
every year due to a poorly- or un-optimised website. Slow websites are one of
online consumers’ biggest frustrations, and a fast way to miss out on sales.

Whether you want to boost revenues, improve conversion rates, reduce churn, or
improve retention and engagement, a well-optimised site is a key way to get
there.

## How It Works

All it takes is five straightforward steps to turn your site around:

<blockquote class="pull-quote  pull-quote--context-alt" id="quote:peter-gibb">
<p>Harry’s performance audit gave comprehensive, forensic insight across the full delivery pipeline. Clearly highlighted priorities brought rapid benefits and a plan for continued improvement. Genius.</p>
<b class="source  pull-quote__source">Peter Gibb, <a href="https://www.icaew.com/">ICAEW</a></b>
</blockquote>

1. **Survey:** To begin, I need to know a lot about your organisation, the
   problems you feel you face, and what we need to concentrate on. I’ll send
   a series of very focused questions that will help me to understand the
   business’ needs immediately.
2. **Audit:** Remotely, I roll up my sleeves and dig in! With an encyclopaedic
   knowledge of all things web-performance, nothing will evade me. From
   infrastructure and the network, to assets and payloads; from CSS and fonts,
   to runtime and rendering (and everything in between), we have a lot to pay
   attention to. I’ll spend at least five days looking through everything I can
   get my hands on.
3. **Report:** Once I’ve uncovered everything, I’ll put together a full report
   outlining all of the issues and problems that exist, as well as preemptive
   optimisations we could make in order to be even faster. The report will
   contain actionable and prioritised tasks that you and your engineers can
   begin to implement in a sensible and considered order.
4. **Handover:** Once you and your team have had chance to read and digest the
   report, you’ll likely have some questions or comments. We’ll hold a formal
   handover session to ensure that you fully understand the entirety of the audit
   document and know what you need to do next.
5. **Reconvene:** One to three months later—depending on what would be most
   appropriate for your organisation—I’ll drop back in and conduct a brief audit
   against your to-do list that I left you with. This phase ensures you’re
   accountable, as well as shows me where any regressions may have happened or
   what you may have struggled to overcome.

## Existing Issues and Opportunistic Optimisations

<blockquote class="pull-quote  pull-quote--context-alt" id="quote:rich-fogarty">
<p>Harry’s focused, practical approach allowed us to implement significant
changes which improved our user experience and overall performance
dramatically. I recommend him wholeheartedly.</p>
<b class="source  pull-quote__source">Rich Fogarty, <a href="http://concreteplayground.com">Concrete Playground</a></b>
</blockquote>

As well as uncovering existing issues that are impacting site performance, I’ll
also be sure to make recommendations where opportunistic optimisations are
concerned: are there any new web platform features we can utilise? Different
approaches we could be taking? Bleeding edge features that we can begin to
introduce? **Instead of just making your site better, let’s make it
a class-leader.**

## Deliverables

Once the audit is complete, you receive:

* **Executive Summary:** A high-level, non-technical Keynote highlighting the
  biggest findings and their implications, as well as immediate- and short-term
  strategic advice for fixing the issues in question. This document is designed
  to orientate and align everyone with a shared understanding of the task at
  hand.
* **Performance Backlog:** A Trello board that I populate as I review the site
  will be made available to your team. Cards have clear checklists covering
  everything from common pitfalls to long-term optimisations. Key tasks are
  created and loosely prioritised in order for your team to hit the ground
  running.
* **Half-Day Handover:** Scheduled for some time after delivery of the report,
  we’ll set aside a half-day for a call in which your engineers can ask
  questions about my findings, I can explain anything that requires it, we can
  look to discuss longer-term strategies, and generally close up the project
  with a formal handover session.
* **Check-In:** Rather than simply leaving you to get on with things unassisted,
  I will check back in within one to three months to see what progress has been
  made—and maintained!—as well as to see what outstanding issues or unresolved
  problems there might be.

## Ten-Minute Teardown

Sometimes, a week-long audit is a little more than you need. Perhaps you only
have a very specific issue you’d like to tackle; maybe you’re not sure how much
input you need at all? For you, we have the _Ten-Minute Teardown_: a quick-fire,
tactical, and straight to the point screencast covering the most immediate
problems you face.

<figcaption>Video is the ideal format for tactical problem solving.</figcaption>
</figure>

You tell me the issue, I run some tests, and then record myself solving it. At
the end, you’re left with a screencast showing exactly how I went about
troubleshooting the issue, as well as its solution.

A teardown is a very pragmatic response to the need for short, targeted advice
that doesn’t require a full audit engagement. It can also be used to triage the
extent of performance issues with your site.

<small>A teardown does not necessarily last for only ten minutes. If I need to
spend 30 minutes, I will. The point is more that the service is a quick-fire,
fast-turnaround format.</small>
