At the end of February 2015, I had the immense pleasure of running a week-long
series of workshops and hack days with Copenhagen-based company [Better
Collective](http://bettercollective.com/). Product Manager
[Alette](https://twitter.com/thealette) got in touch with me asking if I’d like
to help them plan out and begin building the UI for the overhaul of their social
network, [bettingexpert](http://www.bettingexpert.com/). I immediately said
yes.

Alette’s opening emails got me really, really excited. I could tell this was
going to be a great project and that the team were going to be really fun. My
suspicions were proved correct many times over. Choice snippets from those
emails include (emphasis mine):

> It involves quite some risk because we have quite a lot of users (200,000),
> **but it’s worth taking the risk to achieve big goals**.
>
> We are extremely excited about this opportunity to really make something
> stellar, **without having to deal with a lot of legacy**.
>
> We are located in the center of Copenhagen, Denmark, close to the harbour and
> with lots of museums, bars and restaurants around the office. […] We think of
> ourselves as dedicated and fun to work with. **We enjoy what we do and we
> always strive to do it even better!**

I would have to have been mad not to leap at this opportunity with open arms,
and that’s exactly what I did.

Looking back, the craziest thing for me is that these emails actually managed to
understate just how passionate, excited, driven, committed, enthusiastic, open,
and fun the team actually was. This led to what is probably the single most
productive engagement I have ever been involved in. The amount we managed to
cover in just one week was unprecedented, and reinforced my belief that a tiny
team of enthusiastic individuals can far outshine the output of a demotivated
team with triple the manpower.

The core team was me, Alette, and [Andrés](https://twitter.com/allthosehumans),
a Product Designer. We set up camp in a conference room and had different
members of the team drop in and join us for different sessions throughout the
week.

As well as the introductory emails, Alette and Andrés did a fantastic job of
putting together a number of documents to lay the foundations of the week’s
work. These documents covered company history and background, problems faced and
questions they wanted answering (both philosophical and
implementation-specific), and even a list of UI Components they’d like to build
together in order to see how the theory would come together in the real world.
These documents proved invaluable for two main reasons:

1. The way the engagement came about was very sudden. When Alette got in touch
   with me I had two available slots: <q>some time in June, or next week</q>.
   Alette chose the next week option, which meant prep time was almost
   non-existent.  The comprehensive yet terse documentation they sent over
   allowed me to fully prepare for the week in a very short amount of time.
2. They provided a solid frame of reference for everything we did throughout the
   week. We lost no time to planning or logistics once I was on-site, we just
   ploughed through everything we could whilst making sure it always related
   back to these core documents. This kept productivity way, way up!

  we asked he had well thought out answer.</p>

The week was split into two distinct chunks: we had two days of pure theory in a
workshop style format, then we had three days of pairing, hacking, proofs of
concept, and eventually an MVP version of the Better Collective UI Toolkit. It
was highly intensive, incredibly productive, and lots of fun.

We also opened up the workshops to non-UI team members so that they could get a
feel for what we were getting up to, and I also ran two internals talks: one to
the entire company evangelising the great work of the UI team, as well as
sharing the importance and wider business impact of what we were getting up to,
and another to the engineering team which was more of a demo of the kinds of
thing we’d built, how they worked, and why.

In our five days together, we achieved

* rationalisation and streamlining of the design process;
* full, in-depth theory behind architectural concerns and principles;
* the effective management of UI components and their layout;
* guidelines and principles for better teamworking;
* the definition of UI Toolkit goals and responsibilities;
* the evangelisation and awareness of the importance of the UI team’s work;
* the build of a very solid foundation upon which the next several years of work
  can take place;
* and a whole lot more.

  <p>Harry helped us adopt a more minimal approach to our CSS and taught us how
  to organise our framework so we have more flexibility with a fraction of the
  code. […] The code we are writing after Harry’s visit is the best I’ve ever
  had a chance to work with.</p>
  <p>Working with Harry made us confident that what we are building will last
  and will be a pleasure for us to work with—and for the next person joining the
  project—for a long time to come.</p>

I felt very sad when it came to leaving. The work we’d produced in that week was
something that any team would have been proud of, and I honestly felt like I was
part of the family. Better Collective’s company culture was unlike any I’d
personally experienced before—everyone was a friend, everything was incredibly
transparent, everyone loved being there, and I was made to feel so welcome.

A fortnight or so later, I checked in on Alette and Andrés’ work in the GitHub
repo we had set up. They had taken everything we’d spoken about and truly run
with it. Every line of code in that project looked like something I would have
written, right down to the comments. They’d managed to take a very heavy and
intense week of learning, ask all the right questions, and make it become second
nature. I was incredibly impressed, and cannot wait to check back in again in
six months’ time.
