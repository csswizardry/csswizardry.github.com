One of the first clients I worked with after I’d started working for myself was
the <cite>Financial Times</cite>. When
[Andrew Betts](https://twitter.com/triblondon)—Founder and Director of the
prolific [FT Labs](http://labs.ft.com/)—got in touch about me helping them out
with their CSS architecture and development of a UI Toolkit, I was incredibly
excited, and rightfully so:

1. What a great client—the <cite>Financial Times</cite>!
2. FT Labs produce some great (open-source) work—we were big fans of
   [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) at
   [Sky](/case-studies/bskyb/).
3. I love the <cite>FT</cite> as a newspaper—I used to read it a lot when I was
   studying for my Business Studies A-Level.
4. I was also thrilled to be told that a lot of the <cite>FT</cite>’s work was
   based upon a lot of my own articles, talks, and code.

  <p>We’re great fans of Harry at <a href="http://labs.ft.com/">FT Labs</a>, his
     work has had a lot of influence over the CSS architecture of the Financial
     Times web app.</p>

We initially weren’t sure what the extent of our working together might be, so I
recommended we start with some on-site consultancy work to help the team get a
handle on some of the problems they faced, and how we might be able to solve
them. On the day, I woke at 0440 and made my way from Leeds down to the capital
to join Andrew and the team at the <cite>FT</cite> offices in London.

This initial day turned into an intensive, all-day workshop- and
consultancy-style Q&A session as Andrew and some of the <cite>FT</cite>’s core
designers and developers fired questions at me. Over the course of the day we’d
managed to cover topics including:

* **Styleguides and UI Toolkits:** How should they be built, what should go in
  them, how are they updated, what kind of things had we done at Sky to build
  <cite>Aluminium</cite>.
* **Workflows:** Who is in charge of maintaining UI Toolkits, how do changes
  make their way back into the codebase, how do those changes get propagated
  back out again?
* **Culture and working practice:** How do they get company-wide buy-in, how
  would they enforce and police any standards and guidelines?
* **Architectures:** How should the codebase be written to accommodate entire
  projects (they got a preview of [ITCSS](http://itcss.io)) and for components
  that need sharing across products?
* **Techniques and guidelines:** What coding styleguide and rules should be in
  place, what techniques and technologies should they use to achieve certain
  results?

At the end of a long but very fun day, I left the team with a lot of answers to
a lot of questions—looking back at the notes from the day, it’s crazy just how
much stuff we managed to get covered.
