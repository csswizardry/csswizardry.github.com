**Yikes!** I’m afraid it looks like this page doesn’t exist. There are a few
things you can do from here:

{% assign random = site.time | date: "%s%N" | modulo: site.posts.size %}

1. [Head back to the home page](/)
2. [Search Google for what you were looking for](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acsswizardry.com+YOUR+SEARCH+TERM)
3. [Check the archives](/archive/)
4. [Read <cite>{{ site.posts[random].title }}</cite>]({{ site.posts[random].url }})

<script>
(() => {

  // Let’s try guess what they might have been looking for…

  // Get the current URL
  const url = new URL(window.location.href);

  // Grab the 404ing path
  const pathname = url.pathname;

  // Replace any URL-like characters with spaces
  const formattedPath = pathname.replace(/[-_\/]+/g, ' ').trim();

  // Rewrite the Google link above
  const anchor = document.querySelector('a[href*="google"]');
  anchor.href = `https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A${url.hostname}+${encodeURIComponent(formattedPath)}`;

})();
</script>

Hopefully one of those helps you out. If not, you can always [ask me on
