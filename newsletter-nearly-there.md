I just need to confirm your email address. To get you fully subscribed you’ll
need to click the link in the email I just sent you.

There are also a couple of other things you might need to do:

1. **Check your spam or Promotions folders** because the first email(s) might
   end up in there.
2. **Add `harry@csswizardry.com` as a contact** so that CSS Wizardry emails get
   whitelisted. I’m sending from a personal account, so you’re not adding
anything corporate or spammy.

I really wish there weren’t so many hoops for you to jump through. I’m sorry.

See you soon!  
_Harry_
