I just need to confirm your email address. To get you fully subscribed you’ll
need to click the link in the email I just sent you.

There are also a couple of other things you might need to do:

1. **Check your spam folder** because the first email(s) might end up in there.
2. **Add `harry@csswizardry.com` as a contact** so that CSS Wizardry emails get
   allowlisted.

Speak soon!
