  <summary>Do you run workshops remotely?</summary>

  <p>Yes! Owing to 2020’s Coronavirus pandemic, I designed a workshop curriculum
  and format specifically optimised for remote delivery.

  <summary>How many people can attend a workshop?</summary>

  <p>The good news is that I don’t base workshop pricing on the number of
  attendees. Making it harder for people to attend will minimise my impact,
  which defeats the whole purpose of training your team—send as many people as
  you want!</p>

  <p>That said, I would recommend trying to keep numbers under 30. Beyond that
  amount, sessions tend to turn into more monologue, lecture-style sessions that
  hinder both interactivity and productivity.</p>

<details>

  <summary>How long do workshops last?</summary>

  <p>At least one day—a half-day isn’t long enough to cover anything of real
  substance. I recommend running a two-day workshop so that day one can be
  spent learning, and day two spent implementing. It’s hugely valuable to host
  a second hackathon-style second day so that your team can begin to put their
  newfound knowledge into practice with my guidance.</p>

  <p>Beyond that, we can design week-long bootcamps, quarterly refresher
  sessions, and more. It all depends on what you need and what will provide you
  with the most value.</p>

  <p>As always, the best option is to <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> to
  start a no obligation discussion to see what will work best for you.</p>

<details>

  <summary>Can we live-stream or record workshops?</summary>

  <p>If you have the ability to do so, then yes! Live-streaming means you can
  open the sessions up to remote members of the team.</p>

</details>

<details>

  <summary>Can we choose workshop content?</summary>

  <p>Absolutely! We’ll work together to design an itinerary that will best suit
  your team and projects. There’s no point looking at e-commerce case studies if
  you’re a publishing house! We can jump on a call ahead of our engagement to go
  over particular areas of interest and draw up a workshop that’s going to
  deliver maximum value.</p>
