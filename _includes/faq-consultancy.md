  <summary>How much will it cost?</summary>

  <p>You’d be surprised. From $1,000 to $100,000, there’s always something we’ll
  be able to do to help solve your problem. My approach is to design the
  engagement around you, so your best option is to <a href="/contact/">get in
  touch</a> and let me work something out.</p>

  <summary>Do you work with smaller organisations?</summary>

  <p>Absolutely! While my <a href="/#section:clients">client list</a> tends to
  highlight more familiar household names, I love partnering with anyone who’s
  keen to do good work. In fact, some of my most fond memories are joining
  smaller teams and working closely together to solve problems.</p>

  <p>Whether it’s consultancy, audits, or training, the size of your company
  does not matter. There’s something for everyone.</p>

  <summary>How long will it take?</summary>

  <p>Probably not as long as you think! Over the past six years, I have managed
  to optimise my workflow to such an extent that we can move incredibly quickly.
  Vitamix had this to say about it:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Harry’s technique for getting to the root of our needs was phenomenal—he
    proposed a tailor made plan of action, and it was spot on. We were able to
    implement it immediately and it didn’t take weeks or months of ramp-up time.
    It was as if Harry had been in the trenches with us all along!</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>No matter how long it will take us to achieve our goals, the sooner we
  start, the better.</p>
