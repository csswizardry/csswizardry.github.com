  <summary>Do I need to pay to use your code?</summary>
  <p>No, you don’t need to pay to use any of the code shared on <code>csswizardry.com</code>. My content is licensed under the MIT License, which allows free use for both personal and commercial purposes.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Do I need to apply to use your code?</summary>
  <p>No, there’s no need to apply or seek permission. The MIT License already grants you the right to use, modify, and distribute the code as long as you meet its conditions, which primarily involve proper attribution.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Do I need to tell you I’m using your code?</summary>
  <p>You’re not required to inform me, but I’d love to hear about it! It’s always rewarding to see how my work is being used, so feel free to drop me a line if you’d like to share what you’ve built.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>What happens if I don’t comply?</summary>
  <p>If you don’t comply with the MIT License (e.g. by failing to include attribution), you’re in breach of the license. This means you lose the rights granted by it, and technically, your use of the code would be unauthorised.</p>
  <p>I’d prefer to resolve issues amicably, so if there’s a misunderstanding, I’d encourage you to reach out so we can work things out.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Can I use your code in a commercial project?</summary>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>What does ‘proper attribution’ mean?</summary>
  <p>Proper attribution involves giving credit to the original source of the code. Typically, this means including a copy of the license and copyright notice in your repository and a comment in your code.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Can I modify your code?</summary>
  <p>Yes, the MIT License allows you to modify my code to suit your needs. Even if you make changes, you still need to include attribution to the original source.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Does using your code mean you support my project?</summary>
  <p>Not necessarily. While I’m happy to see my code being used, using it doesn’t imply my endorsement of your project.</p>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>What happens if someone else uses your code improperly?</summary>
