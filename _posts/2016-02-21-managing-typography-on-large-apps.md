meta: "A look at managing typography more practically on larger sites and apps"
---

I’ve [written before](http://csswizardry.com/2012/02/pragmatic-practical-font-sizing-in-css)
about managing typographical styles across larger projects, but an issue that I
still see clients continually coming up against is that of specifically managing
their headings across larger and more complex apps.

The problem stems from the styling of the default `h1` through `h6` elements,
and how this hierarchy seldom carries through the actual design and build of
app-like UIs. The `h1`–`h6` pattern pretty nicely mirrors traditional print
documents—where we are much more likely to have more newspaper-style heading
structures both semantically and visually—however, where more app-like UIs
definitely _do_ have the semantic need for `h1`–`h6`, they rarely need quite the
same visual hierarchy.

Think of sites like GMail, Facebook, YouTube—you can’t really see a tiered
heading structure like you could envisage on, say, this site right here. I think
that for blog-style sites the `h1`–`h6` pattern does still have semantic and
visual merit, but for app-like sites—the kind I’m referring to in this post—I
think we need a new approach.

The problem presents itself when we begin designing UIs. Because we know we have
six levels of heading to play with, we’ll go right ahead and design one of each,
regardless of

* whether we actually need them yet;
* how they might actually look when we do need them.

We design a suite of hierarchical headings, usually before we’ve designed
anything else, and then when it comes to building a page, we might semantically
choose an `h3`, only to find it has an appearance which is completely unsuitable
in its location. We chose our look and feel for a level of heading out of the
context in which it might actually be used—we’ve very tightly coupled our
semantic and stylistic decisions here, and we shouldn’t have done.

Think back to almost any project you’ve worked on. How many times has, say, an
`h3` been the semantically correct element to use, only to find its appearance
is either too opinionated or too inappropriate?

This then leads to one of two possible issues:

1. We have to begin writing more CSS to undo or override very specific styles
   applied to a very non-specific selector (e.g. `h3 {}`).
2. We use (or abuse) the incorrect semantic element in order to achieve the
   desired cosmetic output.

Neither are great options, and I can almost guarantee you’ve had to do one of
them at least once in your career.

It’s now my opinion that headings should be a purely semantic decision, and have
no stylistic information applied to them at all. Complete decoupling of the
semantic and the stylistic—your level of heading should have no influence on how
that heading looks.

## Proposal

Something I’ve been implementing is a much more simplified default set of
headings which cover our semantic use cases, and all other font sizes and styles
are introduced through a suite of classes.

This means that there are now only two default font-sizes in our project: our
body copy, and our six headings (which are all identical):

    html {
      font-size: 1em;
    }

    /**
     * Headings are always ‘just a bit bigger’ than body copy.
     */
    h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
      font-size: 1.25rem;
    }

Notice how there are no colours, no font styles, no font families, no nothing.
In fact, you could even get rid of the `font-size` declaration completely if you
want—my thinking is just to have all headings default to being at least slightly
offset from their surroundings.

This approach now gives us great semantic freedom: none of our headings’ look
and feel will guide our choice of element, nor will we misuse an element for the
correct look and feel.

To provide our actual styled suite of headings, we need to move away from the
semantic `h1`–`h6` model, and toward a more purpose-driven model. Instead of
making the decision early on that <q>any `h1` will look like this, and any `h3`
will look like this</q>, we need to be thinking more along the lines of <q>the
biggest style of heading will have a class of <var>x</var>; all section titles
will have a class of <var>y</var>.</q>

These classes will be largely down to the design you’re working with, but they
usually end up looking something like this:

    .c-heading-page {}

    .c-heading-main {}
    .c-heading-sub {}

    .c-heading-banner {}

    .c-heading-section {}

This now leaves us with purpose-driven rather than semantics-driven heading
styles that can be applied to any element we choose (it doesn’t even have to be
a heading element).

The upshot of this is that nearly all of your HTML will look more like this:

    <main>

      <h1 class="c-heading-main">...</h1>
      <h2 class="c-heading-sub">...</h2>

      ...

      <article class="c-tile">
        <h3 class="c-tile__title">...</h3>
        <p>...</p>
      </article>

      ...

    </main>

It would be very unlikely that we see a bare `h1`–`h6` element in our HTML,
because we should no longer be leaning on our semantic decision to give us a
cosmetic output: instead of making the decision early on that we’re going to
have semantics lead a visual decision, we’re deciding to treat them as two
totally separate things.

The key takeaway I’d like to leave you with is the importance of divorcing
semantics and style: our choice of `h1`–`h6` is a purely semantic decision, and
should not carry or impact cosmetics.

Just give all heading elements the exact same cosmetics as each other, and
create your visual heading styles against a series of classes that are
completely separated from the semantics of any element whatsoever.

<small>**N.B.** It’s probably worth reiterating that if you are designing a
blog, a news site, documentation, or anything that does mirror the traditional
headline format found in print, you can probably still carry on attaching more
cosmetic opinions to your `h1`–`h6` element selectors.</small>
