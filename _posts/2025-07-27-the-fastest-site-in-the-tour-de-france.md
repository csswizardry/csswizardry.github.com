**Which bike brand raced ahead in the browser as well as the bunch?**

Today, the 112<sup>th</sup> edition of the [Tour de
France](https://www.letour.fr/en) came to a close. [Wout van
Aert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_van_Aert) won the final stage in Paris,
and [Tadej Pogačar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadej_Poga%C4%8Dar),
predictably, won the overall title, making it his fourth time taking the
[<i>maillot jaune</i>](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillot_jaune).

I’m a huge cycling nerd, and the Tour de France is the pinnacle of the sport.
Three weeks of racing—21 stages—covering 3,338.8 kilometers of terrain, it
really is a marathon and not a sprint.

But that isn’t to say that speed isn’t important! Cycling is a sport obsessed
with aerodynamics, weight savings, and marginal gains. Bike manufacturers obsess
over every gram shaved or watt saved. Cycling is the perfect sport for the
performance engineer because things can always be measured, and they can always
be improved.

And while most of the success undoubtedly lies on the shoulders of the athletes,
as a bike _manufacturer_, having the lightest or fastest bike puts you in a much
stronger position on race day. And indeed, this leads to some fairly outlandish
statements:

> Nothing is faster than the Tarmac SL8 […] it’s more than the fastest Tarmac
> ever – it’s the world’s fastest race bike.  
> — [Specialized](https://www.specialized.com/gb/en/s-works-tarmac-sl8-shimano-dura-ace-di2/p/216953?color=349996-216953)

Or:

> Having a leading high-tech wind tunnel on-site, unique for a cycling brand,
> enables us to build the fastest bikes in the world.  
> — [Ridley](https://www.ridley-bikes.com/en_GB/news/article/83550)

Bold claims, but how do they stack up in the browser? For an industry utterly
obsessed with speed, how does that translate to its online presence? Every
individual in the peloton wants to be the fastest rider, and every bike
manufacturer that sponsors them claims to have the fastest bike, but **who has
the fastest website?**
 
I took a look at the sites of every bike manufacturer that has a presence in
2025’s Tour (all 21 of them) and ran the numbers. My question: **does a bike
brand’s focus on web performance predict their performance on race day?**

The results are in…





## The Teams and Bikes of the 2025 Tour de France

In total, [23 teams](https://www.letour.fr/en/riders) are sponsored by 21
different bike brands. All teams that compete in the Tour de France are
[WorldTeam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_WorldTeam) status, except for
selected [ProTeams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCI_ProSeries) (marked below)
who are invited to compete in a similar manner to _wild cards_ in tennis.

What I want to work out is, of those teams, which of their bike manufacturers
put as much effort into web performance as they do race-day performance?





## The Fastest Bike Sites in the 2025 Tour de France

To rank the bike brands, I used my own proprietary [CrRRUX
score](/2024/11/designing-and-evolving-a-new-performance-score/) (higher is
better). CrRRUX is specifically designed to compare the [Core Web
Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals) data of a finite cohort of origins,
placing them proportionally on a 0–1 scale. Given just how close a lot of the
sites seem to land, I had to push CrRRUX to four decimal places.

Core Web Vitals, for folk who haven’t come across them before, are three web
performance metrics that are designed to measure site-speed in a way that
reflects how they actually _feel_. Human-centric signs of fast or slow:

* **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** How fast did the page and its content
  load?
* **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** How quickly did the page respond to user
  input?
* **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Did elements jump around the page as it was
  loading?

It is around these three metrics that this meta analysis is conducted.

The headline news is right here. According to their relative CrRRUX score, here
are the bike brands from fastest to slowest:

When we look at the raw data with some colour coding, a fascinating pattern
emerges: a lot of sites performed incredibly well. The fastest 10 pass all three
Core Web Vitals. The general state of web performance in the cycling industry
seems very healthy!

The best-performing sites include Merida, Factor, Giant, Look, and Enve, all scoring near-perfect 1.0000 CrRRUX values. In contrast, Ridley and Orbea score lowest, with Ridley’s CrRRUX at 0.0000 and Orbea at 0.2292. The table includes LCP, INP, CLS, weighted and aggregate scores, highlighting significant variation in real-world user experience across brands’ official websites." width="1500" height="695" loading="lazy">
  <figcaption>A visual comparison using <a href="/2024/11/designing-and-evolving-a-new-performance-score/">CrRRUX</a> highlights interesting insights.</figcaption>
</figure>

A clear cliff appears between rows 12 (Lapierre) and 13 (Pinarello) when sites
suddenly move from failing one or all of the Core Web Vitals to overwhelmingly
passing all three. This is measured by the [_Ordinal_ score—around which CrRRUX
is heavily
weighted](/2024/11/designing-and-evolving-a-new-performance-score/#naive-approach-1-ordinal-score)—and
means any site that only passes, say, two Core Web Vitals cannot rank above any
site that passes all three.

The fact we go from high-70s to high-90s in one leap isn’t something one
typically observes in these kinds of comparison. There’s no deep or hidden
meaning there—it’s just a very interesting thing to see.





## Deeper Analysis

I decided to look further into what made the top three stand out (and the bottom
three come over the line with the
[gruppetto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autobus_(cycling))), so I did some
individual analysis of this subset of six bike brands:

| Rank | Brand       | Sponsors of…                               | CrRRUX&nbsp;Score |

I tested the homepage and the product page for the specific bike the teams are
likely to use in a race. This is because the UCI mandates that all bikes used by
race teams must either be already available for purchase by the general public,
or must be available to them within 12 months of the race:

> Equipment shall be of a type that is sold for use by anyone practising cycling
> as a sport. Any equipment in development phase and not yet available for sale
> (prototype) must be subject of an authorization request to the UCI Equipment
> Unit before its use. Authorization will be granted only for equipment which is
> in the final stage of development and for which commercialization will take
> place no later than 12 months after first use in competition.  
> — _Article 1.3.006_

Crucially, that means any of the bikes raced and sites tested are subject to use
by real people. **This isn’t a theoretical exercise.**

What follows is an incredibly high-level look at how each site performs and
suggested areas for improvement. **Subscribers will get to see much more
in-depth analysis.**

### 🥇 Merida

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.cloudinary }}/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/merida-pdp.jpg" alt="Merida REACTO TEAM aero road bike with deep-section wheels and team Bahrain Victorious livery, displayed on a white product background with detailed geometry, specs, and download links—ideal for elite racers and enthusiasts." width="1500" height="887" loading="lazy">
<figcaption><a href="https://www.merida-bikes.com/en/bike/4850/reacto-team">Merida REACTO TEAM</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Founded in 1972, Merida is a Taiwan-based design and manufacture operation.
Interestingly, for the first 16 years of its life, Merida only produced bikes
for other brands, and only launched its own line of cycles in 1988.

Fascinatingly, Merida is fast in spite of its site, not because of it. Some
very quick-fire analysis…

#### General Findings with Merida

| LCP (ms) | INP (ms) |  CLS |
|---------:|---------:|-----:|
|    1,188 |       77 | 0.00 |

Despite utilising Vue.js 2.1.10 in places, Merida’s site is a pretty
traditional—dare I say _old school_—MPA. I can’t work out the exact stack too
quickly, but it sticks to ‘classic’ CSS and JS, and age-old advice like
<q>styles at the top; scripts at the bottom</q>. This reminds of the
McMaster–Carr site that did the rounds a few years ago: websites _are_ fast
until developers start messing around with them.

* They host all of their [critical path resources on a third-party
  origin](/2019/05/self-host-your-static-assets/)!
  * This adds a lot of network overhead.
* They don’t have a proper font stack in place (`font-family: 'Uni Sans';`) so
  they get a FOUT showing Times New Roman.
  * No `font-display` rules either!
  * Their fonts’ [origin could be
    `preconnect`ed](/2023/12/correctly-configure-preconnections/).
* Aggressive `cache-control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` means `200`s
  on every request.
  * They could drop it down to just [`no-store,
    private`](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/csswizardry_quick-caching-caveat-no-store-might-activity-7303763824388558848-oKEr/)
    if they really do want to forgo [HTTP
    caching](/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/) on every single page view,
    or a more liberal `no-cache` coupled with either `Etag` or `Last-Modified`
    if they wanted to ensure freshness but also make use of cache after an
    immediate `304`.
* They cache their static assets for six months but don’t attach revalidation
  headers.
  * Based on `Age` headers (I saw one at `1990959` seconds!), these files don’t
    change very often at all.
* Their URLs work both with and without a trailing `/` but they have no
  `rel=canonical`s set up.

#### Merida’s Homepage Highlights

* **URL:** [merida-bikes.com/en](https://www.merida-bikes.com/en)
* **WebPageTest:** [webpagetest.org/…/250804_ZiDcGY_AFS](https://www.webpagetest.org/result/250804_ZiDcGY_AFS)

<figcaption>Their LCP image is entry 34. Note the 250ms connection overhead added to the critical path at entry 2—we’d like to avoid this wherever possible.</figcaption>
</figure>

Issues specific to the homepage:

* Their LCP is
  a [`background-image`](/2022/03/optimising-largest-contentful-paint/#background-image-url)
  which is never great without some additional help from `preload`.
* Not only is the image late-discovered, it suffers a large _Element Render
  Delay_ while the main thread is busy with heavy Scripting and Rendering tasks.

<figcaption>It might have a <code>.tif</code> extension, but their LCP image is
actually a <code>image/jpeg</code> <code>content-type</code>.</figcaption>
</figure>

And issues specific to their product details page:

* Their LCP image comes in at a weighty 379.2KB! That’s pretty large.
  * They don’t employ any form of responsive images, either. This means that
    even on the smallest screens we still fetch a 2,500px image.
* Their LCP image is fetched with _Medium_ priority; we’d rather that be _High_.
  * Although because it’s an `<img>`, it at least hits the network before their
    JS, unlike in the homepage.
* Again, we see a large _Element Render Delay_ while we wait on the main thread.

#### Takeaways

Merida is a great example of simply not getting in the way of the browser. Sure,
they have room for improvement, but even then they are still coming in at number
one. By not throwing every npm package in the world at the site—by simply
[betting on
boring](/2025/01/build-for-the-web-build-on-the-web-build-with-the-web/)—they’ve
sustained class-leading performance. That’s more than can be said for most
‘modern’ stacks.

Chapeaux, Merida!

### 🥈 Factor

<figcaption><a href="https://factorbikes.com/bikes/ostro-vam">Factor OSTRO VAM</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Founded in 2007 in Norfolk, England, Factor Bikes began life as an offshoot of
motorsport engineering firm bf1systems. The company’s early projects included
high-performance prototypes before it launched its first commercial bike, the
Factor ONE, in 2013.

#### General Findings with Factor

| LCP (ms) | INP (ms) |  CLS |
|---------:|---------:|-----:|
|    1,248 |      119 | 0.00 |

Our second fastest site, Factor, is built on Shopify’s headless _Hydrogen_
storefront and deployed onto their _Oxygen_.

* Factor is built as a _Single Page App_ with soft navigations.
* I’ve never see `<head>` tags so tiny! Only nine items in the source HTML.
* Unfortunately, they do have a number of assets on third-party origins.
  Persistently across the site, that is a stylesheet on the `unpkg.com` CDN.
  * This is easily remedied by pulling the file onto first party infrastructure.
  * I must have said this a million times by now, but please, [self-host your
    static assets](/2019/05/self-host-your-static-assets/)!
* No `cache-control` headers means HTML responses can’t be accurately
  revalidated, always returning a `200` when it could have been a `304`.
  * The absence of a `cache-control` header is not enough to count as a [caching
    strategy](/2019/03/cache-control-for-civilians/).
  * However, as everything else is so well cached, including LCP images,
    repeat-view LCP metrics are substantially faster.
* We’re also missing proprietary `Oxygen-Cache-Control` headers, meaning we
  can’t get edge cache hits either.
* LCP images on both pages are both `background-image`s that are
  late-discovered.
  * They also live on yet another third-party origin that is not
    `preconnect`ed—Contentful’s `images.ctfassets.net`.

<figcaption>Their LCP (42) is weirdly late-discovered.</figcaption>
</figure>

* The homepage compounds the `unpkg.com` problem by also making requests to the
  first/third-party `cdn.shopify.com` origin.
  * It would be wise to add `Link` HTTP response headers to `preconnect` this
    origin. Cloudflare, who Factor are fronted by, can then upgrade these to
    `103 Early Hints` for them.
* The homepage LCP image is very late discovered (entry 42 at 1.7s), and on
  a different origin, as discussed, but it’s also enormous! 1,235.1KB of WebP.
  * There is some synchronous JS visible at around 1.7s on line 1 that must be
    further blocking the discovery of the `background-image`.
  * To make matters worse, Contentful’s response heavily interleaves image bytes
    with less critical images, returning non-LCP resources (43–47) before our
    key candidate.

waterfall!</figcaption>
</figure>

There really isn’t much different between the homepage and product detail pages.
In fact, there are more similarities.

* Unfortunately, the LCP is a `background-image` once again.

#### Takeaways

This site is a remarkable exercise in restraint. No heavy-handed runtime, a very
considerate approach to third parties. A modern stack without any modern
baggage. I’m impressed, Factor!

### 🥉 Giant

<figcaption><a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/propel-advanced-sl-0-red">Giant Propel Advanced SL 0 (Red)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Established in 1972, Giant is a Taiwanese brand headquartered in Taichung.
Originally a manufacturer for other companies, Giant began producing bikes under
its own name in 1981 and has since grown into the world’s largest bicycle
manufacturer.

#### General Findings with Giant

| LCP (ms) | INP (ms) |  CLS |
|---------:|---------:|-----:|
|    1,298 |      105 | 0.01 |

Giant took third place on our podium. It looks as though they make use of
Vue.js—or at least Vue Cart—but no obvious signs of a framework such as Nuxt.

* Giant is built as a _Multiple Page App_. Or as we used to call them,
  _websites_.
* No word of a lie, they have a `spacer.gif`!
* Pages open three new connections: two to `https://static.giant-bicycles.com`
  and one to `https://images2.giant-bicycles.com`.
  * The `static.` origins are on the critical path.
* They make use of old school, JS-based lazy loading.
* They use unquoted `attribute=value` pairs like I do—_nice_.
* Great restraint shown here—only a small number of resources loaded from the
  `<head>`.
  * Non-critical CSS files are fetched asynchronously.
* They’re making good use of `font-display`.

<figcaption>That very last request is their LCP candidate! That’s far too late.</figcaption>
</figure>

* They’re lazily loading their homepage LCP!
  * With JS, no less. Super slow. It’s the 84<sup>th</sup> request.
  * It’s getting requested _after_ Facebook, Google Tag Manager, Google
    Analytics, and Klaviyo have been completely returned.
  * And they’re putting `fetchpriority=high` on there. Make your mind up!

<figcaption>There’s no point fast-fetching your LCP if you’re going to wait so
long to paint it.</figcaption>
</figure>

* The LCP image is `preload`ed now, meaning the `images2.` connection is
  negotiated much earlier on PDPs.
  * This is why it’s now the sixth request as opposed to the 84<sup>th</sup>.
  * The `preload` needs `fetchpriority=high`
  * The killer here is the fact that we don’t put the LCP on the glass for
    a very, very long time.
  * In the screenshot above, we see our LCP image is on the device by about
    1.5s, but our LCP event doesn’t fire until approximately 7s (the dashed
    green line).
  * This eyewatering _Element Render Delay_ is down to the fact that Giant move
    to a client-rendered architecture for their image gallery (and _Add to
    Cart_) on PDPs.
* Our repeat view has heavily cached assets, but as the LCP event is so runtime
  dependent, we get no customer-facing performance improvements.

#### Takeaways

With the Giant site, we’re in a place where looking at two pages in isolation
actually look quite bad—there are a couple of egregious decisions that put them
on the back foot. But looking at the site overall, they’re glowing. It would be
interesting to drill down into specific page- and template-types.

### Trek

</figure>

Founded in 1976 in Waterloo, Wisconsin, Trek was created with a mission to build
high-end bikes in the United States. It has since become a major global player,
with a strong focus on innovation and racing pedigree across road and mountain
disciplines.

#### General Findings with Trek

| LCP (ms) | INP (ms) |  CLS |
|---------:|---------:|-----:|
|    2,869 |      210 | 0.15 |

Trek is a cycling powerhouse! One of the bigger brands in the peloton, how have
they found themselves toward the back of the pack? Trek use fully
client-rendered Vue.js on top of SAP Commerce Cloud, deployed on Azure and
fronted by Cloudflare.

* Fully client-rendered Vue.js (without Nuxt, etc.).
* They still force hard navigations, so every page view runs into a high boot-up
  cost—it runs as an MPA.
* They have a silly redirect whereby their logo links to `/us/en_US`, but the
  resulting URL is actually `/us/en_US/`. This adds pure latency onto every
  homepage click.
* Most pages don’t place-hold client rendered content very well at all,
  explaining their high CLS scores.

#### Trek’s Homepage Highlights

<figcaption>Client-side rendering spells disaster for this late-rendered LCP
image.</figcaption>
</figure>

* I haven’t included the full waterfall for any of the sites so far, but it’s
  worth noting that Trek’s homepage yielded 262 requests!
* The homepage’s LCP (29) is actually fetched relatively quickly, despite being
  fully client-rendered.
  * And JS-lazy loaded once it arrives—wow!
  * This slow-path request for the LCP image got it onto the device by about
    five seconds, but we don’t display it until approximately 15 seconds!
* The homepage seems to have its app-shell pretty well place-held as there is no
  CLS penalty.
* Another very aggressive `cache-control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0,
  must-revalidate` header means we get `200` responses on every subsequent
  visit.
  * Almost all other directives are redundant in the presence of `no-store` as
    if there is nothing to store, there is nothing to cache, nothing to expire,
    and nothing to revalidate. Still, it doesn’t do any harm to include them
    all.
* INP scores are pushed up by a huge _Recalculate Style_ event when opening the
  nav.
  * In situations like this, [CSS containment](/2026/04/what-is-css-containment-and-how-can-i-use-it/)
    can sometimes help localise that work.
  * They’re reading style properties while also attempting to write them.
  * As just 2.9× CPU throttling, this event took an eyewatering 154ms!

<figcaption>The story gets worse as key content is late-fetched via client-side
API calls.</figcaption>
</figure>

* Interestingly enough, the video on the PDP isn’t classed as the LCP
  candidate—it’s a piece of text that appears quite a lot earlier.
  * The PDP’s ‘obvious’ LCP candidate is a YouTube video loaded via an `iframe`.
    Both RUM and synthetic testing cannot detect `iframe`-originated LCP’s for
    privacy reasons, but CrUX, being part of Chrome, can. The upshot of this is
    that developers might wrongly assume that the site is much faster than it is
    if they are relying on Lighthouse, DevTools, WebPageTest, or anything other
    than CrUX.
* The rest of the PDP’s LCP story is a bit of a car crash. As content loads on
  the client, the LCP candidate keeps on changing (all while CLS scores keep on
  increasing). Once the browser does settle on its LCP candidate, Trek fade it
  in! Chrome takes the end of the animation as its LCP timestamp, further
  exacerbating the issue.
  * The API response that contains the LCP content is the 148<sup>th</sup>
    request!
* Product pages are not sufficiently place-held to safeguard CLS scores: the
  main app shell is empty, and oncoming content is not place-held either.

#### Takeaways

The Trek site going all in on client-side Vue has left it struggling to hit
decent paint timings. This coupled with particular page types not being
adequately place-held gives us the CSR double whammy of LCP and CLS penalties.
I can only imagine (or hope) Trek might have a rebuild or replatform on the
horizon—seeing fully-client rendered Vue is already something of a relic.

</figure>

Founded in 1840 in the Basque Country of Spain, Orbea actually started out
making guns. It pivoted to bicycles in the 1930s and is now one of the oldest
bike manufacturers in the world, known for its sleek, performance-oriented
designs.

#### General Findings with Orbea

| LCP (ms) | INP (ms) |  CLS |
|---------:|---------:|-----:|
|    5,050 |      138 | 0.41 |

Orbea is deployed as an MPA but uses Alpine.js for client-side templating. Other
than that, it’s quite difficult to see what stack they’re on.

* Orbea is deployed as an MPA.
  * They suffer incredibly high TTFB.
  * And they also have an extremely aggressive `no-store, no-cache,
    must-revalidate` policy.
  * This means every page view is a back end-heavy trip to origin:
    `cf-cache-status DYNAMIC`.
* They link to a lot of
  [render-blocking](/2024/08/blocking-render-why-whould-you-do-that/) resources,
  including third-party ones.
* They use Typekit which [contains an
  `@import`](/2018/11/css-and-network-performance/#avoid-import-in-css-files)—a
  real killer.
  * It’s particularly harmful for Orbea as the bulk of their JavaScript is
    blocked behind it.
  * They’re attempting to use `Typekit.load()` but it’s undefined.
* Their fallback font is very different to their custom font; different enough
  to almost go over 0.1 CLS on the homepage.
* They seem to have the same `rel=canonical` issues as Merida.
* They make sporadic use of `font-display`.

</figure>

* They lazy load their LCP on the homepage.
  * The sheer amount of JS that runs beforehand means it’s discovered incredibly
    late—entry 89.
* However they don’t lazy load images much further down the page.
  * They also omit `alt` and `width` and `height` attributes.
* They fetched about 11.8MB of images.

  * One points at `https://unpkg.com/tippy.js@6` which then `302`s to
    `/tippy.js@6.3.7/dist/tippy-bundle.umd.min.js`.
  * This adds a whole round trip of latency to the critical path and is only
    cacheable for one minute.
* They appear to be attempting a JS-based lazy loading strategy with `data-src`
  attributes but they also have a non-empty `src` that points to the mobile
  image anyway.
  * This means desktop will fetch the mobile image and, conditionally, the
    desktop image.
* The PDP has two near (if not completely) identical carousels on it—more
  additional fetches.
  * JS hides one of the carousels, but not before incurring a severe layout
    shift.
* You see those two colour swatch images in the screenshot above? The two
  bisected circles? They are both 822KB JPEGs.
  * How?!

#### Takeaways

It’s first byte times that are crippling Orbea. Setting even a modest `max-age`
(and allowing Cloudflare to serve cached HTML responses) would take the edge
off. Typekit—and the way they’ve placed it—cause them severe paint-timing
issues. Blocking on top of blocking on top of blocking. The double-carousel
issue on the PDP accounts almost exactly for their CLS scores. That would be
a quick win for them.

<figcaption><a href="https://www.ridley-bikes.com/en_US/bikes/SBINF3RID082">Ridley Noah FAST 3.0</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Established in 1997 in Belgium by Jochim Aerts, Ridley has built a reputation
around aerodynamic innovation and cobble-tough endurance bikes. Its roots in
Flemish cycling culture are unmistakable, and its bikes are a regular fixture in
the pro peloton.

#### General Findings with Ridley

| LCP (ms) | INP (ms) |  CLS |
|---------:|---------:|-----:|
|    4,694 |    1,121 | 0.61 |

* Ridley is built on Nuxt and is a soft-navigation SPA.
* They fetch Google Maps in a blocking manner.
* They also have a blocking tracking script on a separate origin which always
  causes a network request as it’s marked `max-age=0`.
* Their LCP candidates live on separate asset domains.
* The fallback font is so far from the web font that it causes severe layout
  shifts.
* There are no caching headers whatsoever, which is inadvisable.
  * But as they do have an `ETag` header, `304`s are possible.
* Nuxt is doing that annoying pattern where it `preload`s a CSS file then
  immediately requests it with `rel=stylesheet` right after.
  * It’s not harmful, but it’s not helpful either, and ends up marking blocking
    requests as non-blocking which is misleading.
  * On the subject of `preload`, they’re [`preload`ing Google
    Fonts](/2020/05/the-fastest-google-fonts/) but also async-injecting it with
    JavaScript. Again, not harmful, but also not much point either.
* The real killer for Ridley is a near-infinite `requestAnimationFrame()`. The
  whole time we have a page open, `rAF()` is in a non-stop repetition.
  * This is how we end up with a 1s+ INP score.
  * You can see this in the waterfalls below. It stops after about 20 seconds.
* Interestingly, despite being visible much earlier, the actual LCP event in
  WebPageTest didn’t fire until the nonstop `rAF()` settles down briefly.
* Thankfully, assets are fingerprinted and [cached for
  a year](/2023/10/what-is-the-maximum-max-age/).
* Their Nuxt JS bundles are defined at the `</body>` with both `async` and
  `defer`. In this scenario, [`async` always
  wins](https://x.com/csswizardry/status/1331721659498319873).
  * `async` is an open invite for race conditions, so I can only assume their
    bundles have been designed to run independently (otherwise, expect lots of
    errors and bugs).

<figcaption>A staggeringly large LCP image on line 23. That much dark purple is
bad news.</figcaption>
</figure>

* The LCP image is 1.4MB!
  * On slower connections, this is a killer.
  * It is in the HTML at least—they should stick `fetchpriority=high` on there.
* The homepage ‘carousel’ is actually stacked one pane on top of the other
  rather than in a row like a traditional carousel.
  * This means that while the heavy images are downloading, we see loads of
    stacked text nodes which looks very broken.

<figcaption>Even modern image formats like AVIF can’t do much to help us here.</figcaption>
</figure>

* The LCP image is in the initial HTML as an `<img>`, but missing
  `fetchpriority=high`.
  * They’re actually attempting to lazy load it! But thankfully also getting it
    wrong: `lazy=true`.
* When you switch between different bike sizes, you get huge layout shifts.
* We have more poorly optimised images.
  * 16MB of the 24MB transferred is image data.
* The PDP’s HTML payload is gargantuan.
  * Almost 4MB decompressed—almost all of it is Nuxt state (`window.__NUXT__`).
* We have an eyewatering 5MB of JS.
  * 12MB of the total 37MB uncompressed page bytes are JavaScript.
  * That’s not a typo.

#### Takeaways

Before we focus on the bad, Ridley’s new Noah 3.0 won its first ever race. And
at the Tour de France, no less. It also marked the first ever Tour stage win for
Uno-X Mobility, the team that ride Ridley’s bikes. That’s more of a win than any
Core Web Vitals, so congratulations are in order. Let’s take a moment.

But onto the job at hand. Ridley is struggling a lot with all three metrics. LCP
is hampered by already-high first-byte times, leaving only a 500ms budget to get
from TTFB to LCP. The majority of their lost time happens between FCP and
LCP—this is almost all lost to _Element Render Delay_. This may well be the
phenomenon observed above: the LCP event doesn’t fire until the main thread dies
down.

On the subject of the main thread, the constantly-firing
`requestAnimationFrame()` is dragging them into the very pits of INP—well over
one second! This isn’t because the main thread is necessarily blocked—`rAF()` is
relatively noninvasive and each one only lasts a small amount of time—but the
main thread is just kept _so_ busy, it’s hard to sneak any user input in.

<figure>
<img src="{{ site.cloudinary }}/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ridley-raf.png" alt="" width="1500" height="477" loading="lazy">
<figcaption>Note that while none of the tasks are <em>long</em>, there are thousands of them back-to-back. It literally is thousands in that screenshot.</figcaption>
</figure>

Finally, because INP is so high, a lot of interactions take over 500ms which
then puts us outside of the 500ms grace period for CLS: `hadRecentUserInput:
false`.

I honestly think just sorting out that `requestAnimationFrame()` would start to
take chunks out of the other metrics, too.

## Patterns and Insights

As a cycling enthusiast, perhaps the most surprising insight for me was that
most of the larger, wealthier, and most prestigious brands tend to appear in the
slower half of the cohort. Is this complacency? An Apple-esque arrogance? Who
knows.

**Big brands aren’t always the best performers.**

Several of the industry’s most recognisable names fall startlingly low on this
list. Trek, Orbea, and Specialized—brands with global reach and significant
marketing clout—rank 19<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 13<sup>th</sup>
respectively. Their reputations far outpace their web performance.

**High-end doesn’t always mean high CrUX scores.**

Colnago (17<sup>th</sup>), Wilier (18<sup>th</sup>), and Bianchi
(15<sup>th</sup>) are all brands dripping with prestige and heritage (and the
price tags to match), but in terms of web performance, they’re clustered towards
the bottom of the group. This might suggest that legacy and luxury don’t always
translate into digital excellence—or perhaps that their customer base tolerates
slower experiences in exchange for reputation and perception.

**The underdog story is online-first.**

Merida and Factor might not be the first names fans think of when naming
top-tier race bikes, but they do top this table with near-perfect CrRRUX scores.
These brands show that operational excellence, modern manufacturing, and
attention to digital experience can co-exist without the century-old heritage.

## The Fastest Team Sites in the 2025 Tour de France

As a bit of an added stretch goal, I decided to run the numbers for each of the
team sites to see if any patterns emerged. These are the CrRRUX scores for each
_team_ site that raced the 2025 Tour de France:

<ol>
  <li style="list-style-type: '🥇 '">Team Picnic PostNL – 0.9999</li>
  <li style="list-style-type: '🥈 '">Bahrain Victorious – 0.9982</li>
  <li style="list-style-type: '🥉 '">Israel–Premier Tech – 0.9978</li>
  <li>Ineos Grenadiers – 0.9972</li>
  <li>Intermarché–Wanty – 0.9928</li>
  <li>Lotto – 0.9919</li>
  <li>UAE Team Emirates–XRG – 0.9895</li>
  <li>Uno–X Mobility – 0.9893</li>
  <li>Groupama–FDJ – 0.9892</li>
  <li>EF Education–EasyPost – 0.9888</li>
  <li>Arkéa–B&amp;B Hotels – 0.9847</li>
  <li>Soudal Quick-Step – 0.9792</li>
  <li>Cofidis – 0.9761</li>
  <li>Team TotalEnergies – 0.9705</li>
  <li>XDS Astana Team – 0.9701</li>
  <li>Lidl–Trek – 0.9587</li>
  <li>Movistar Team – 0.9585</li>
  <li>Team Visma | Lease a Bike – 0.7959</li>
  <li>Tudor Pro Cycling Team – 0.7941</li>
  <li>Red Bull–BORA–hansgrohe – 0.7445</li>
  <li>Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team – 0.7175</li>
  <li>Alpecin–Deceuninck – 0.5588</li>
  <li>Jayco–AlUla – 0.5562</li>
</ol>

<ol>
  <li style="list-style-type: '🥇 '"><strong>Team Picnic PostNL</strong>, sponsored by Lapierre</li>
  <li style="list-style-type: '🥈 '"><strong>Bahrain Victorious</strong>, sponsored by Merida</li>
  <li style="list-style-type: '🥉 '"><strong>Israel–Premier Tech</strong>, sponsored by Factor</li>
</ol>

**The fastest bike brand also supports a mid-ranked team.**

Merida tops the CrRRUX rankings for manufacturers (1.0000) but sponsors Bahrain
Victorious—only 17<sup>th</sup> in the final Tour standings. The Bahrain
Victorious team site, however, is the second-fastest overall. It’s a rare
alignment: fast bike site, fast team site, middling result.

**Factor and Israel–Premier Tech deliver on both fronts.**

Factor comes second in the CrRRUX bike table (0.9986) and Israel–Premier Tech
ranks third among team sites (0.9978). This is one of only two pairings where
both bike and team site land in the top three for performance. Their Tour
placement? 18<sup>th</sup>. Fast site, slow legs.

**Jayco–AlUla ride one of the fastest bike sites but have the slowest team site**

Giant ranks third in the bike CrRRUX table (0.9985), but Jayco–AlUla come dead
last for team website performance (0.5562). Their Tour
finish—17<sup>th</sup>—sits toward the bottom. Perhaps the team should take some
performance tips from Giant’s developers?

Could we conclude that Merida and Factor and Bahrain Victorious and
Israel–Premier Tech care about performance in all aspects of their operations?

## The Fastest Teams in the 2025 Tour de France

Finally, I also wanted to look at the fastest overall teams in the 2025 Tour de
France and see how they stacked up against their sponsors:

Here we can see there is very little correlation.

## Appendix

### Credits and Inspiration

My good friend and peer [Jake Archibald](https://jakearchibald.com/) wrote
a multi-part piece in 2021 asking [<cite>Who has the fastest F1 website in
2021?</cite>](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/f1-perf-part-1/). That should
definitely be seen as the genesis of this post.

### Methodology

I took the most [up-to-date CrUX
data](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/history-api) (blended mobile and
desktop data) for the most recent time period available on the final stage of
the Tour (27 July 2025). CrUX data is based on real users’ experiences.

I pulled that data into Google Sheets where I ran it through my own [CrRRUX
algorithm](/2024/11/designing-and-evolving-a-new-performance-score/)—a metric
designed to objectively and fairly rank a cohort of origins’ Core Web Vitals
data.

For each of the fastest and slowest three sites, I took the homepage and the
product details page for their flagship, high-end road race bike. I then ran
a series of synthetic tests with [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/).
Below are the tests and the relevant scripts.
