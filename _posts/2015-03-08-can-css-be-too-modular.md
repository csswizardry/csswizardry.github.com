I frequently get asked questions along the lines of <q>Can CSS be too
modular?</q> I recently got asked about this in an email, which I’ve published
below:

> * Could the `div` or `a` exist without one another?
> * Are any of the classes thematically related?
> * Do these classes appear side by side purely coincidentally?
> * Do we need all classes to remain intact if we were to reuse this HTML?
> * Do all classes when combined create a specific UI component?
> * Are any of the classes optional at this point?

>
>     .btn-promo {

>       @extend .fs-m;
>       @extend .d-bk;

> only once in the codebase. This ensures consistency (updated values are picked
> up throughout the entire project) and, more importantly, ease of maintenance.
> DRY is about repetition in source, not repetition-in-general.
> 
> To this end, I would just ensure that the values we’re interested in (6px,
> 12px, 24px, etc.) are only ever written once and then are simply recycled
> throughout the project. This is just as DRY (in terms of the Single Source of
> Truth) but also allows for more readability and context/knowledge in the HTML.

> Here’s a very crude proof of concept:
> [sassmeister.com/…/87b2da6cbd80d3f1f993](http://sassmeister.com/gist/87b2da6cbd80d3f1f993).
> We can see from this that we only actually have one number involved at all, so
> we have achieved the Single Source of Truth, and we can just reuse it and its
> spawned size-variants very easily.
> 
> And now our HTML is more like this:
> 
>     <div class="box  box--promo">
>         <a href="#" class="btn  btn--small  btn--positive">Log in</a>
>     </div>
> 
> This tells us a heck of a lot about what’s going on in the DOM, it tells us
> that these classes are thematically related; it tells us which bits are
> optional, and it tells us what are candidates for change (i.e. anything with a
> `--` prefix).
> 
> There is absolutely no reason you can’t have utility classes—I even do this
> myself—but they should be the exception rather than the rule. Avoid building
> entire sections of UI out of them.
> 
> Abstracting classes out as far as Atomic CSS (or any other similar
> approach—this isn’t a criticism of Atomic CSS specifically) suggests will
> sacrifice (at the very least) context, readability, and maintainability, in
> favour or smaller filesizes. I feel this is overkill, especially considering
> that gzip would negate any difference in filesize anyway. We need to find that
> sweet spot, and I feel Atomic CSS (and paradigms like it) overshoot the mark.
