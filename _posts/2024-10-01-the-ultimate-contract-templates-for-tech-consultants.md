As a [tech consultant](/consultancy/), having airtight contracts isn’t just
about the paperwork—it’s about protecting your business and ensuring you get
paid on time. I’ve developed a [Contracts Starter
Pack](https://csswizardry.gumroad.com/l/contracts-starter-pack) specifically for
tech consultants to address common challenges, such as securing intellectual
property, managing payment terms, and avoiding scope creep.

## Why You Need Contract Templates as a Tech Consultant

In the fast-paced world of tech consulting—especially where shorter, more
tactical engagements are concerned—it’s easy to dive into projects without fully
considering the legal protection you need. Contracts provide clarity between you
and your clients, ensuring there are no misunderstandings around deliverables,
payment, and project scope.

## What’s Inside the Contracts Starter Pack?

There are Basic and Premium Starter Packs available. In them, you will find:

* **Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):** Protect confidential information
  shared with your clients.
* **Master Services Agreement (MSA) [Premium]:** Perfect for long-term,
  multi-project relationships, paired with detailed Statements of Work (SOWs).
* **Terms of Consultancy Agreement:** Clearly outline what you’re doing and how
  you’re getting paid.
* **Statement of Work (SOW) [Premium]:** What will you deliver, and how much
  will it cost?
* **Retainer Agreements (Day-Based and Always-On) [Premium]:** Define your
  availability, either by the day or through an ongoing advisory model.
* **Service Level Agreement (SLA) [Premium]:** Set expectations for performance
  and response times.

## Who Benefits From These Templates?

These templates are primarily aimed at tech consultants working on projects that
range from software development to IT infrastructure, digital transformation,
and web performance optimisation. Whether you’re managing one-off projects or
long-term client engagements, these documents ensure you stay legally protected
while streamlining your operations.

That said, these are useful contract templates for any independent consultant
who wants to be perceived as a consummate professional.

## Why Use These Contract Templates?

1. **Custom-Built for Tech Consultants:** Unlike generic templates, these
   contracts consider the unique needs of tech consultants—like intellectual
   property, evolving project scopes, and handling multiple clients.
2. **Protect Your IP:** Ensure you retain ownership of your pre-existing
   intellectual property, and only transfer IP once all payments are cleared.
3. **Get Paid on Time:** Set clear terms around payment, deposits, and milestone
   payments to avoid cashflow issues.
4. **Avoid Scope Creep:** Use a solid Statement of Work to define project
   deliverables clearly.
5. **Peace of Mind:** By outlining everything in a contract, both you and your
   client are protected, ensuring a smooth working relationship.
