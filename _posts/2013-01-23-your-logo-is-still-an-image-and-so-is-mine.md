Almost two years ago I wrote
[an article about image semantics](/2010/10/your-logo-is-an-image-not-a-h1/)
which covered the appropriate markup for your site’s logo. In short, it stated
that logos are content and should therefore be marked up as `img` elements,
**not** `h1`s, as is a very common practice.

The `h1` method is used for two _main_ reasons:

1. It allows you to sprite up your logo.
2. The misconception that a logo is somehow a heading.

My article – which I still stand by – debunked the second, but the former is a
point of interest…

I received [an issue](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry.github.com/issues/18)
on [the CSS Wizardry repo](https://github.com/csswizardry/csswizardry.github.com/)
asking me to go into more detail about how I handle things here:

**tl;dr** To balance the correct semantics with better performance.

So, I previously wrote that you should not use an `h1` for your logo, but you
should use an `img`. Here’s the markup that I use on CSS Wizardry right now
<small>(January, 2013)</small>:

<pre><code>&lt;a href="/" class="site-logo"&gt;
    &lt;img <mark>src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw=="</mark> alt="CSS Wizardry" class="s  s--csswizardry-logo"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

You should notice that my `src` attribute doesn’t point to `logo.png` or similar,
but to a Base64 encoded 1×1px transparent gif.

## Eww, what?!

What I am doing here is pointing my `img` at a small transparent gif, and then
using CSS to apply an SVG sprite as a background image. Here I am using an `img`
which is semantically correct, but I am also being a little crafty and using CSS
to apply the image that people actually see. Here is the (S)CSS:

    .s{
        background-image:url(/img/css/sprites/main.svg);
    }
    .s--csswizardry-logo{
        width:64px;
        height:64px;
        background-position:-5px -5px;
        @include vendor(background-size, 250px 250px);

        @include media-query(desk){
            @include vendor(background-size, 500px 500px);
            width:128px;
            height:128px;
            background-position:-10px -10px;
        }
    }

All I am doing here is defining a spriting object (`.s`) and then extending that
class with `.s--csswizardry-logo` (with some responsive bits added in).

It is important to remember here that – even though it is only a 1×1px
transparent gif – my logo _is still an image_.

Before I can get to _why_ I am doing this, we need establish some groundwork…

## People and machines

{% include promo-case-studies.html %}

It is a gross oversimplification, but an important distinction we need to make
when it comes to HTML and CSS is the one between people – our users – and
machines.  We typically (for the _vast_ majority of cases) have two things
accessing our sites; machines, like screenreaders and search bots; and people,
who can see and interact with our website.

With this in mind, we typically build our sites considering those two scenarios.
That’s the whole reason we build websites accessibly and care about code, but we
still want the site to look pretty, so we design it up as well. This is us
catering to both machines and users.

**N.B.** A visually impaired user visiting a website via a screenreader counts as
a machine as it is the screenreader which deals with the code and then passes it
along, rather than the user processing the site directly. I realise how offensive
this may seem, calling visually impaired users machines, but it’s the only way I
can word the fact that in _this_ scenario it is a machine accessing the website –
albeit controlled by a person – but not a person directly.

### Semantics is for machines

Knowing this, we can begin to understand that only machines care about `img`
elements. From a user’s perspective it makes no difference whether we use an
`img`, a Flash object, a background image on a `div`, anything! The `img` is
only useful for machines (screenreaders, search bots etc). This is why we have
semantics.

Machines also utilise `alt` text; `alt` text isn’t for users to access, it is
for machines to access and then pass to the user if necessary.

So, semantically speaking, all a correct implementation of an image needs to be
is an `img` element with some `alt` text, as this is what machines require;
machines (where we as front-end developers are concerned) have no idea, nor do
they even care, as to what the actual pixel content of an image is. If you have
an `img` element with an empty gif as its `src` and ‘CSS Wizardry’ as its `alt`
text then all the machine knows is that this is an image with that alternate
text; it has no idea as to the content of the image file.

### Images are for people

The actual pixel content of an image _does_ matter to people, the code does not.
With this in mind, it doesn’t matter _how_ we apply the styling to the machine’s
`img` element, because users don’t care (though we’d obviously use CSS).

This is the important distinction; `img`s serve _two_ purposes:

1. To tell a machine there’s an image, and some `alt` text if applicable.
2. To display a graphic to a user.

By splitting these requirements right down the middle, we now understand how we
can serve a 1×1px transparent gif as a semantically valid image, and validly
apply the visual image via CSS.

## But, why?!

It’s taken me a while, but here we are, _why_ am I doing this?

The short answer is performance.

Anyone following CSS Wizardry’s posts, or me on Twitter, over these last couple
of years will know that I have been getting more and more heavily involved in
much larger projects where architecture and performance are paramount, and I
love it!

One of my favourite things about this side of web development is how it fuses
really impressive, interesting performance ‘hacks’ with ‘ugly’ markup. Two years
ago I strove for semantic perfection and ‘hand-crafted’ my code; now I see code
as an awesome powertool for creating big, fast websites. Spriting up empty
elements is all part of this fun!

Spriting images is performance basics, we all know why we need it, but it’s
important to keep the correct semantics wherever possible, hence me spriting up
an `img` element.

If, semantically, a logo _has_ to be an image, and you want to sprite this image
up, then the best way to achieve this is to have the `img` itself being
see-through. By using a 1×1px transparent gif then you get this see-through
behaviour attached to a tiny image.

Now, this image _is_ initially an extra HTTP request,
[a performance no-no](/2013/01/front-end-performance-for-web-designers-and-front-end-developers/#section:http-requests-and-dns-lookups),
**but**:

* **It’s only a few bytes in size** so it’ll be over the wire in no time.
* **Any subsequent usage is free** because the browser won’t re-request it.
* **You can cache it forever** because a 1×1px transparent gif will never need
  updating.

You would be forgiven for thinking you could just point your `src` at a nonexistent
image, which would result in a 404 and not having to transfer _any_ image back
over the wire. The problem with this however is that – with there being no asset
downloaded – there is nothing for the browser to cache. This means that if you
had five sprited `img`s on your page you’d also have five 404ing HTTP requests,
and nothing getting cached for reuse. The initial overhead of one more HTTP
request for `dot.gif` can _soon_ pay off because that little image can be cached
indefinitely and reused again and again. This isn’t even to mention the fact
that the only reason you’re doing this to be able to sprite images, which is
saving you loads of requests anyway!

It is important to note that spriting images won’t always be necessary and/or
possible. I’m not saying you should do it all the time, and I am saying you
quite often can’t (fluid images, for example). It’s just another possible tool
to put in your toolbox.

So there we have it; spriting an `img` allows us to use the correct semantics
and also take even more advantage of sprites! A machine sees an `img` labelled
‘CSS Wizardry’ (perfect) and a user sees my logo (awesome)! Everyone is happy,
everything is correct.

**Edit:** As many people have suggested, you could use a [Base64
data](/2017/02/base64-encoding-and-performance/)-URI instead of a gif and save
the additional HTTP request. This obviously isn’t cachable in the same way as an
image is, and also does bring certain other downsides you ought to be aware of!
