with themselves."

This is a really short post to publish an email thread I just had with a
client-turned-friend who’d emailed me asking for a bit of advice concerning
self-chained classes (e.g. `.foo.foo {}`).

The question was basically surrounding the number of ‘links’ in the chain and
its relation, if any, to the number of times that class appears in the HTML.
That is to say, does `.foo.foo {}` equate to specifically `class="foo foo"`, and
`.foo.foo.foo {}` to `class="foo foo foo"`, and so on?

**Client, to me:**

So yeah. Chaining classes doesn’t actually count (or look out for) <var>n</var>
classes in your markup, it just asks the same question <var>n</var> times.

If, for whatever reason, you do need to ‘count’ the number of classes, you’ll
need to hard-code an attribute selector with the exact number in there. This
will be quite brittle as the whitespace is stringified as well, so if your
template puts classes on a new line (or anything like that) the string will no
longer match. Plus, we’re not technically counting anything: we’re looking out
for an exact string that we just happen to have typed the same sequence of
characters into several times.
