You may remember me Dribbbling [a couple](http://dribbble.com/shots/99264-Secret-project) [of shots](http://dribbble.com/shots/99266-Secret-project-02) last month about a 'secret project' I've been working on. Well, it's here! [in:focus](/in-focus/) is simply a micro-site that aims to interview some of the web's best.



[![](http://csswizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/in-focus.jpg)](/in-focus/)

The site took me about three hours from concept to first phase, then about an hour to port it over to WordPress, so about 4-5 hours in total. I'm pretty pleased with the design, and it has a tablet and mobile version, too.

Even more exciting than that, however, is my first guest. None other than [Oliver Reichenstein](http://twitter.com/iA)--owner of international agency [Information Architects](http://informationarchitects.jp/) and brains behind [Writer](http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/writer-for-ipad/)! Head over to read [my Q&A; with him](/in-focus/oliver-reichenstein/).

in:focus has no fixed publishing schedule, and if you have any suggestions for interviewees then please let me know. Any feedback would also be great; as I said this project was purposefully 'rushed' as I wanted to see how quickly I could turn an idea into a reality. Many thanks to Oliver for helping this happen.

Enjoy, I hope...
