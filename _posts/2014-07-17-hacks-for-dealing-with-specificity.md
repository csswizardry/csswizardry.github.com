As we’re all probably well aware by now, specificity is one of the quickest ways
to get yourself in a tangle when trying to scale a CSS project: even if you have
the most considered source order, and your rulesets cascade and inherit
to and from each other perfectly, an overly-specific selector can completely
undo all of it. Specificity throws a real curve-ball at a language which is
entirely dependent upon source order. To make things worse, you can’t opt out of
it, and the only way to deal with it is by getting more and _more_ specific.

On larger projects, this is something we can really do without.

Like I said, we can’t opt out of specificity, but there are a number of things
we can do to mitigate its effects:

* **[Never use IDs in
  CSS](/2011/09/when-using-ids-can-be-a-pain-in-the-class/)**,
  ever. They have no advantage over classes (anything you can do with an ID, you
  can do with a class), they cannot be reused, and their specificity is way, way
  too high. Even an infinite number of chained classes will not trump the
  specificity of one ID.
* **Do not nest selectors** unnecessarily. If `.header-nav {}` will work, never
  use `.header .header-nav {}`; to do so will literally double the specificity
  of the selector without any benefit.
* **Do not qualify selectors** unless you have a compelling reason to do so. If
  `.nav {}` will work, do not use `ul.nav {}`; to do so would not only limit the
  places you can use the `.nav` class, but it also increases the specificity of
  the selector, again, with no real gain.
* **Make heavy use of classes** because they are the ideal selector: low
  specificity (or rather, all classes have the same specificity, so you have a
  level playing field), great portability, and high reusability.

**tl;dr** never use a selector more specific than the one you need.

These are all very simple rules—and are very easy to follow if you’re starting
a new project—but what happens when you need to hack specificity? We all know
about `!important`, which I won’t go into here, but how can we trick specificity
into being lowered or increased with no drastic side effects?

## Low specificity IDs

If you’ve ever been on any of my workshops, you will know that—right up front—I
like to stress that **no rules are unbreakable**. There will always be
exceptions, there will always be a situation which requires a rule to be bent,
there will always be anomalies. Whenever someone says <q>always do
<var>x</var></q>, apply some [critical
thinking](/2013/01/you-know-your-context-on-critical-thinking-and-thinking-for-yourself/)
to work out the principles behind that rule, and take and break the bits you
need to.

One exception to this exception, however, is the use of IDs. There is _never_ a
time when using an ID in CSS makes sense; there is never a good reason to use
one; this rule is not breakable. Even if you were working with third-party
markup that you can’t edit, and all that is in that markup is an ID, you can
still avoid using that ID in your CSS.

{% include promo-case-studies.html %}

<small>**N.B.** Using IDs in your HTML, as fragment identifiers, or in your JS,
as hooks, is totally fine—it’s in CSS that IDs are troublesome.</small>

Let’s imagine you have this third-party widget embedded on your page, and you
want to style it:

    <div id="widget">
        ...
    </div>

Naturally, given that we can’t edit this HTML to use a class instead of (or
alongside) the ID, we’d opt for something like this:

    #widget {
        ...
    }

Now we have an ID in our CSS, and that is not a good precedent to set. Instead,
we should do something like this:

    [id="widget"] {
        ...
    }

This is an attribute selector. This is not selecting on an ID _per se_, but on
an element with an attribute of `id` which also has a certain value. This
particular selector is basically saying <q>Hey, find me an element with an
attribute called `id` which has a value of `widget`.

The beauty of this selector is that [it has the exact same specificity as a
class](http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/V4JX6/), so we’re selecting a chunk of
the DOM based on an ID, but never actually increasing our specificity beyond
that of our classes that we’re making [liberal use of
elsewhere](/2012/10/a-classless-class-on-using-more-classes-in-your-html/).

But **this is a hack.**

Just because we know a way of using IDs without introducing their heightened
specificity, it does not mean we should go back to using IDs in our CSS; they
still have the problem of not being reusable. Only use this technique when you
have no other option, and you cannot replace an ID in some markup with a class.

## Safely increasing specificity

I was recently reminded of this little trick after seeing it in [Mathias
Bynens](https://twitter.com/mathias)’ slidedeck [<cite>3.14 Things I Didn’t Know
About
CSS</cite>](https://speakerdeck.com/mathiasbynens/3-dot-14-things-i-didnt-know-about-css-at-css-day-2014):
**you can chain a selector with itself to increase its specificity**.

That is to say:

    .btn.btn {
    }

…will select based on only one class (`.btn`) but with double the specificity.
We can take this as far as we need to:

    .btn.btn.btn.btn {
    }

…but hopefully we’ll never get that far.

Let me illustrate this with an example:
[jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n](http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n/).

Here we can see that the `.box a {}` <small>(line 17)</small> selector’s `color`
declaration <small>(line 18)</small> overrides the `.btn {}` <small>(line
22)</small> selector’s `color` declaration <small>(line 26)</small>, causing the
button to use a totally unsuitable color which is the same as its background.

We could fix this with an `!important` <small>(line 26)</small>:
[jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n/1](http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n/1/),
but _ewww_, no thanks.

We could also add another selector to the `.btn {}` ruleset <small>(line
23)</small>: [jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n/2](http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n/2/),
but this isn’t a very maintainable solution at all: what happens when it’s not
just boxes that are the problem? We can’t really keep on adding a new selector
every time we need to bump up specificity.

But what we _could_ do is double the specificity of `.btn {}` against _itself_
<small>(line 28)</small>:
[jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n/3](http://jsfiddle.net/csswizardry/3N53n/3/)

This still isn’t great, but it does heighten the specificity of the `color`
declaration (and any other declarations we choose to place in the `.btn.btn {}`
ruleset) without having to depend on a context (e.g. when in a `.box`, when in
the `.nav`, etc.) and without having to keep a growing list of selectors
maintained. This is a really nice way of increasing specificity in isolation.

Again, this is something of a hack, but it’s the best of a bad bunch when it
comes to increasing specificity. At least this way there’s very little
maintenance overhead, and no reliance on a location or context.

So there we have it; two ways of safely hacking (and remember, these are hacks)
your specificity up or down.
