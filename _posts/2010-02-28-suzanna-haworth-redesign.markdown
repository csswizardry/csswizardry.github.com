Having only put the first version of Suze's site live [a few months ago](/2009/12/suzanna-haworth-photography/), we both decided it needed a whole new approach. Originally a static site, built with my own PHP framework, it relied on manual updates from me, which meant that for the sake of efficiency updates had to happen once there was enough content to upload; ergo not very often. After porting CSS Wizardry over to Wordpress and being very impressed, I decided that was the best approach for Suze too. This meant she could update her own site as often as she wanted.

Also, [follow Suze on Twitter](http://twitter.com/suzehaworth).




As the site was built very quickly, we are adapting it as it grows and fixing any bugs as they happen. Let me know if you find anything astray. Anyway, enough talking, [go look for yourselves](http://suzannahaworth.com/)!
