Since founding `csswizardry.com` in 2007, I’ve shared [hundreds of
articles](/archive/), tips, tricks, techniques, snippets, and more—**all for
free**. These have ranged from simple one-liners to concepts that have shaped
the way thousands of developers approach their work.

This freemium model has been the cornerstone of my consultancy business for the
last 11 years, and as someone who learned to code from freely available
resources, I’m deeply committed to keeping this knowledge accessible to
everyone.

While it’s incredibly rewarding to spot code inspired by my work across the web,
it can be disheartening to see it used without any attribution or credit. With
this decision, I aim to maintain the free and open spirit of `csswizardry.com`
while ensuring a small nod of recognition in return.


## Motives

Over the years, conscientious developers and organisations have occasionally
reached out to ask if they can use my code in commercial settings. My answer has
always been an informal _yes!_

However, I feel it’s time to provide more structure and clarity. From now on,
everything shared on `csswizardry.com`—unless stated otherwise—is covered by the
MIT License.

This move isn’t about restricting or limiting usage. Instead, it formalises my
commitment to sharing my work freely while making it clear to commercial
organisations that they’re welcome to use it in for-profit ventures without
worrying about licensing fees or compliance issues.

In return, all I ask for is appropriate credit. I think that’s fair.

## The MIT License

I chose [the MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit) because it’s one
of the most permissive and widely used licenses available. It allows you to use,
modify, and reproduce my work freely, whether for personal or commercial
purposes.

At the same time, it protects me by absolving any liability for how the content
is used. It’s a win-win.

The MIT License is already a familiar standard in the open-source world, so the
chances are you or your company have used work under this license before. It’s
simple, clear, and works perfectly for my goals.
