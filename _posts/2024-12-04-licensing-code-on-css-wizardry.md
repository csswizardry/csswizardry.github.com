---

Since founding `csswizardry.com` in 2007, I’ve shared [hundreds of
articles](/archive/), tips, tricks, techniques, snippets, and more—**all for
free**. These have ranged from simple one-liners to concepts that have shaped
the way thousands of developers approach their work.

This freemium model has been the cornerstone of my consultancy business for the
last 11 years, and as someone who learned to code from freely available
resources, I’m deeply committed to keeping this knowledge accessible to
everyone.

While it’s incredibly rewarding to spot code inspired by my work across the web,
it can be disheartening to see it used without any attribution or credit. With
this decision, I aim to maintain the free and open spirit of `csswizardry.com`
while ensuring a small nod of recognition in return.


## Motives

Over the years, conscientious developers and organisations have occasionally
reached out to ask if they can use my code in commercial settings. My answer has
always been an informal _yes!_

However, I feel it’s time to provide more structure and clarity. From now on,
everything shared on `csswizardry.com`—unless stated otherwise—is covered by the
MIT License.

This move isn’t about restricting or limiting usage. Instead, it formalises my
commitment to sharing my work freely while making it clear to commercial
organisations that they’re welcome to use it in for-profit ventures without
worrying about licensing fees or compliance issues.

In return, all I ask for is appropriate credit. I think that’s fair.

## The MIT License

I chose [the MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit) because it’s one
of the most permissive and widely used licenses available. It allows you to use,
modify, and reproduce my work freely, whether for personal or commercial
purposes.

At the same time, it protects me by absolving any liability for how the content
is used. It’s a win-win.

The MIT License is already a familiar standard in the open-source world, so the
chances are you or your company have used work under this license before. It’s
simple, clear, and works perfectly for my goals.

## Using My Code: What to Know

Here are answers to common or expected questions about using my code under the
MIT License.

<details name="license-faq" open>
  <summary>Do I need to pay to use your code?</summary>
  <p>No, you don’t need to pay to use any of the code shared on <code>csswizardry.com</code>. My content is licensed under the MIT License, which allows free use for both personal and commercial purposes.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Do I need to apply to use your code?</summary>
  <p>No, there’s no need to apply or seek permission. The MIT License already grants you the right to use, modify, and distribute the code as long as you meet its conditions, which primarily involve proper attribution.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Do I need to tell you I’m using your code?</summary>
  <p>You’re not required to inform me, but I’d love to hear about it! It’s always rewarding to see how my work is being used, so feel free to drop me a line if you’d like to share what you’ve built.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>What happens if I don’t comply?</summary>
  <p>If you don’t comply with the MIT License (e.g. by failing to include attribution), you’re in breach of the license. This means you lose the rights granted by it, and technically, your use of the code would be unauthorised.</p>
  <p>I’d prefer to resolve issues amicably, so if there’s a misunderstanding, I’d encourage you to reach out so we can work things out.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Can I use your code in a commercial project?</summary>
  <p>Yes, you’re free to use my code in commercial projects. The MIT License permits this, and there are no hidden fees or obligations beyond proper attribution.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>What does ‘proper attribution’ mean?</summary>
  <p>Proper attribution involves giving credit to the original source of the code. Typically, this means including a copy of the license and copyright notice in your repository and a comment in your code.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Can I modify your code?</summary>
  <p>Yes, the MIT License allows you to modify my code to suit your needs. Even if you make changes, you still need to include attribution to the original source.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>Does using your code mean you support my project?</summary>
  <p>Not necessarily. While I’m happy to see my code being used, using it doesn’t imply my endorsement of your project.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
  <summary>What happens if someone else uses your code improperly?</summary>
  <p>If you’re aware of someone misusing my code, feel free to let me know. However, enforcement is ultimately my responsibility, and I’ll handle it as needed.</p>
</details>

<details name="license-faq">
