One of the questions I get asked most frequently is <q>what do `--` and `__`
mean in your classes?</q>

The answer is thanks to [BEM](http://bem.info) and
[Nicolas Gallagher](http://twitter.com/necolas)…

BEM – meaning <i>block</i>, <i>element</i>, <i>modifier</i> – is a front-end
naming methodology thought up by the guys at [Yandex](http://yandex.ru). It is a
smart way of naming your CSS classes to give them more transparency and meaning
to other developers. They are far more strict and informative, which makes the
BEM naming convention ideal for teams of developers on larger projects that
might last a while.

It is important to note that I use a naming scheme _based_ on BEM, but [honed by
Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/).
The naming techniques covered in this post are not the original BEM ones, but
are improved versions that I much prefer. Whatever the actual notation used,
they are all based on the same BEM principles.

The naming convention follows this pattern:

    .block{}
    .block__element{}
    .block--modifier{}

* `.block` represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.
* `.block__element` represents a descendent of `.block` that helps form `.block`
  as a whole.
* `.block--modifier` represents a different state or version of `.block`.

The reason for double rather than single hyphens and underscores is so that your
block itself can be hyphen delimited, for example:

<pre><code>.site-search{} <span class="code-comment">/* Block */</span>
.site-search__field{} <span class="code-comment">/* Element */</span>
.site-search--full{} <span class="code-comment">/* Modifier */</span></code></pre>

The point of BEM is to tell other developers more about what a piece of markup
is doing from its name alone. By reading some HTML with some classes in, you can
see how – if at all – the chunks are related; something might just be a
component, something might be a child, or <i>element</i>, of that component, and
something might be a variation or <i>modifier</i> of that component. To use an
analogy/model, think how the following things and elements are related:

    .person{}
    .person__hand{}
    .person--female{}
    .person--female__hand{}
    .person__hand--left{}

The top-level block is a ‘person’ which has elements, for example, ‘hand’. A
person also has variations, such as female, and that variation in turn has
elements. This again, but written in ‘normal’ CSS:

    .person{}
    .hand{}
    .female{}
    .female-hand{}
    .left-hand{}

These all make sense, but are somewhat disconnected. Take `.female` for example;
female what? What about `.hand`; a hand of a clock? A hand in a game of cards?
By using BEM we can be more descriptive but also a lot more explicit; we tie
concrete links to other elements of our code through naming alone. Powerful
stuff.

Taking the previous `.site-search` example again, with ‘regular’ naming:

    <form class="site-search  full">
        <input type="text" class="field">
        <input type="Submit" value ="Search" class="button">
    </form>

These classes are fairly loose, and don’t tell us much. Even though we can work
it out, they’re very inexplicit. With BEM notation we would now have:

    <form class="site-search  site-search--full">
        <input type="text" class="site-search__field">
        <input type="Submit" value ="Search" class="site-search__button">
    </form>

We can see that we have a block called `.site-search` which has en element which
lives inside it called `.site-search__field`. We can also see that there is a
variation of the `.site-search` called `.site-search--full`.

Let’s take another example…

If you are familiar with OOCSS then you will no doubt be familiar with
[the media object](http://stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code).
In BEM form, the media object would now read:

    .media{}
    .media__img{}
    .media__img--rev{}
    .media__body{}

From the way this CSS is written we can already glean that `.media__img` and
`.media__body` must live inside `.media` and that `.media__img--rev` is a slight
variation on `.media__img`. All that information gathered from the names of our
CSS selectors alone!

Another benefit is the combatting of the following situation. If we take the
media object again:

    <div class="media">
        <img src="logo.png" alt="Foo Corp logo" class="img-rev">
        <div class="body">
            <h3 class="alpha">Welcome to Foo Corp</h3>
            <p class="lede">Foo Corp is the best, seriously!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

From looking at this, we can’t see how the classes `.media` and `.alpha` are
related to each other? Are they? What about `.body` and `.lede` or `.img-rev`
and `.media`? From that HTML (unless we’re very familiar with the media object)
we have no idea what makes up that component and what else is optional.
If we were to rework it with BEM:

    <div class="media">
        <img src="logo.png" alt="Foo Corp logo" class="media__img--rev">
        <div class="media__body">
            <h3 class="alpha">Welcome to Foo Corp</h3>
            <p class="lede">Foo Corp is the best, seriously!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

We can now instantly see that `.media` is the block, `.media__img--rev` is an
element of `.media` that has a modifier applied and `.media__body` is an
unmodified element of `.media`. All through the names of their classes. That is
**incredibly** useful.

## Uuuugly!

A common argument against BEM is that it’s ugly; I dare say that if you shy away
from code based _purely_ on its looks then you’re often missing the point.
Unless the code becomes unecessarily  difficult to maintain, or genuinely more
difficult to read, then perhaps you _do_ need to think twice before using it,
but if it ‘just looks odd’ but has a valid purpose, then it should definitely be
fully considered before writing it off.

I agree that BEM does look weird, but the power it brings _far_ outweighs any
negatives to do with its appearance by an order of magnitude…

BEM may look a little funny – and it might require more typing (most text
editors have autocomplete, and gzip will negate any differences in filesize) –
but it is **so** powerful.

## To BEM or not to BEM?

I use BEM notation on everything I build now as its usefulness has proved itself
over and over. I’d strongly encourage others to consider adopting it as well
because it just makes everything a lot tighter and more connected, making code
easier to maintain by teams, or even just by yourself a few months down the
line.

When you are using BEM, though, it is important to remember that you don’t need
to use it for everything. Take for example:

    .caps{ text-transform:uppercase; }

This CSS would never fall into any BEM category, it’s merely a standalone rule.

Another example of code which isn’t BEM:

    .site-logo{}

Here we have our logo; it could be BEMmed up like so:

    .header{}
    .header__logo{}

But that is unecessary. The trick with BEM is knowing when something falls into
a relevant category. Just because something happens to live inside a block it
doesn’t always mean is is actually a BEM element. In the case of our site logo 
it lives in the `.header` purely coincidentally; it could just as easily be in
our sidebar or footer. An element’s scope can start in any context, so you need
to make sure you only apply BEM as far as you need to. Another example:

    <div class="content">
        <h1 class="content__headline">Lorem ipsum dolor...</h1>
    </div>

Here we migh be able to just call the second class `.headline`; it depends on if
it is styled that way **because** it’s in `.content`, of whether ot just
_happens_ to live in `.content`. If it is the latter then we do not need BEM.

Everything is potentially open to moving into BEM territory, though. Taking our
`.site-logo` example again, imagine that we want to have a festive version of
the logo for our Christmassy site design. We could have:

    .site-logo{}
    .site-logo--xmas{}

We can quickly build variations of things by using the `--` modifier notation.

One of the hardest parts of BEM is deciding when to start and stop scope, and
when (or not) to use it. It’s a case of ‘you’ll just know when you know’.

## Final word

So that’s BEM (or a slight variation thereof); a highly useful, powerful and
simple naming convention to make your front-end code easier to read and
understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit and a
lot more strict.

For all BEM looks a little odd, it as a hugely valuable addition to the
front-end developer’s toolbox, no matter the project.
