Almost three months ago I handed in my notice at
[Sky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSkyB), where I’d spent the last
two-and-a-bit years as a Senior Developer. My time at Sky has been amazing; I
learned so much about big sites, architecture, scalability, performance, big
teams, maintenance, working on products and a lot, _lot_ more. Sky has been
great – and the most formative work of my career so far – so choosing to leave
was an incredibly difficult decision; one which took a long time to make. You
can read a lot more about that in my (now infamous) post,
[<cite>Make it count</cite>](http://csswizardry.com/2013/07/make-it-count/),
from back in July. Now, for the next chapter…

**I’m going it alone.**

I’ve spent over five years working on CSS Wizardry; [writing articles](/archive/),
sharing [techniques and code](http://github.com/csswizardry) and research and
findings, creating and contributing to [open source projects](http://inuitcss.com),
[speaking at conferences](https://speakerdeck.com/csswizardry) and a whole lot
more. Now I want to make all this stuff work for me. I want to take all the
things I do – and have done – and do them for you, whoever and wherever you may be.

I want to work with talented teams – working on amazing products – all across
the globe. I want to work with nice people who care as much about building great
things as I do, and having fun in the process. I want people who take their
work, but not themselves, seriously. I want to work with you.

I am going to become available from the end of October/mid-November so –
regardless of your location, budget, requirements or whatever – if you think we
could work together then
[let me know](mailto:harry@csswizardry.com). We’ll see what we can work out.

My _ideal_ clients – the ones who would benefit from me the most –
are startups and products who have tech teams I can collaborate with. I
specialise in scaling front-ends on products with skilled engineers. If you’re a
startup expecting to grow, I can help that happen. If you’re a developer working
on a product that needs someone to build a robust and scalable front-end, I’m
your guy. If you’re an agency who needs help training your team to be able to
build bigger websites for bigger clients,
[get in touch](mailto:harry@csswizardry.com).

That said, I have no lists of what I can and cannot do, nor do I have lists of
what I will and will not do, I’m open to pretty much anything. If you think
your team or product or app or service or agency or startup could benefit from
anything I could offer then just [drop me a line](mailto:harry@csswizardry.com).
One of the most important things that I want to gain from this (ad)venture is
_variety_. From consulting to dev work, workshops to speaking, I want to work on
an array of things for nice people. I don’t mind what your product or project
is, or what your budget may be, let’s chat it over and see what we can do
together.
