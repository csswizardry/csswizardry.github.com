The vast majority of my working life is spent running workshops and training
events for clients all over the globe. From the smallest of independent
companies, to organisations with over 300,000 employees, I have taught hundreds
of people who to write better, more scalable, more maintainable CSS, and how to
make substantial savings on their load times.

I have a number of pre-written workshops that are suitable for one- or two-day
engagements, or we can work on something a little more bespoke—just [get in
touch](/contact/).

With a truly international reputation, my workshops have been delivered from New
Zealand to Romania, Uruguay to the US. You’re in good hands.

Workshop clients include: Google, General Electric, Etsy, Kickstarter, the BBC.

## Front-end Performance

The newer of my workshops, the Front-end Performance masterclass will help
developers to deliver websites to users in record times. You will learn

* the moral and business impact of good performance;
* how the network really works, and how to play to its strengths and weaknesses;
* how to optimise our assets for most effective delivery;
* how to trick the browser into downloading things ahead of time;
* how to detect and troubleshoot performance issues;
* how to measure performance successes;
* how to prepare for the performance landscape of tomorrow.

  <p>We hired Harry to provide performance consultancy on a high
  profile and highly trafficked website for one of Europe’s most recognised
  authorities. His detailed and intricate knowledge of how the network and the
  browser work allowed him to improve performance by over 400%, all without
  sacrificing or removing any assets or features from any of the website. By
  analysing how the site was put together, and how browsers were dealing with
  it, he managed to optimise and restructure things in such a way that load
  times went from around 6.25 seconds to just 1.5.</p>

My performance work has been implemented on very highly trafficked and
high-availability websites, making dramatic improvements to page speed without
sacrificing the quality or integrity of any of the website’s content or assets.

## CSS Architecture

My signature workshop has been constantly updated and running for almost three
years now, with new materials introduced as they become relevant. Attendees will
learn

* how to refine the design process to aid our architectural efforts;
* how to modularise and decompose UI components in both designs and code;
* strict naming conventions to make code more self-documenting;
* the ITCSS architecture for scalable and maintainable CSS;
* how to handle layout in a responsive world;
* theming and customising views;
* and a whole host more.

  <p>We loved having Harry at Kickstarter! His CSS workshop was tremendously
  helpful in getting our design team ready for our own CSS overhaul, and his
  visit left us with some much needed guidance and motivation. He’s a great
  communicator with great ideas, and he really knows how to get a team on the
  same page.</p>

well known organisations.
