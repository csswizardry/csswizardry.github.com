**Your team armed with my knowledge.**

  <p>I got a lot of feedback from the attendees here and they loved it. They
  asked if we could do more with you, possibly get more time. People who do
  workshops for us are appreciated, but the feedback I got with what you did was
  something else.</p>

As a consultant, it is my job to inform and educate. One of the most effective
ways to do that is through practical, focused workshops.

With a 99% approval rating, my workshops are not your typical corporate training
session. They’re intense, intensive, and packed with real-world, practical
insights. I’m a teacher who _does_.

Topics, format, and content can be worked out together to best suit your needs,
but generally speaking, we’ll be focusing on the entire gamut of front-end web
performance: tooling, techniques, case studies, insider knowledge, tips, tricks,
and a whole lot more.

We’ll look at your own sites and products as I take your team through the exact
steps needed to correctly identify and address site-speed issues. At the end of
it all, you end up with an up-skilled team and a faster website. It’s a win-win.

## Lockdown Learning

Missing conferences? Wanting to keep your team sharp during times of no travel?
I’ve written an entire workshop, <cite>Web Performance Back to Front</cite>,
designed specifically for remote delivery. Delivered to teams anywhere—or all
over!—the world, optimised for highly practical online delivery, and recorded
for you to keep forever.

Want an idea of the topics we’ll cover? Take a look at the slide-deck from my
canonical _Front-End Performance_ workshop.

If we go on to work together, I’ll fully refund the cost of the slides—I don’t
want you to pay me twice.
