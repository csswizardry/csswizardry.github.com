I run a small and occasional newsletter—my _secret blog_. It’s where I share
thoughts and insights that don’t make it onto this site: lessons from
consulting, client tales, takes on the industry, and other part-formed ideas I’d
normally only share with pals.

Join over 4,000 others who like being in on the action:

## Sponsors

If you’re a product, company, or event who would like to sponsor issues of the
newsletter, please [get in touch](/contact/).
