Imagine my delight when ISO got in touch. I love a spec, I love a standard, so
working with _the_ [International Organization for
Standardization](https://www.iso.org/) is a bit of a dream come true! As a Brit,
[ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) and [ISO
3103:2019](https://www.iso.org/standard/73224.html) are particularly close to my
heart, so to work with the folk that write them…? It’s a yes from me.

Conversations stared in October 2024 with a view to kicking off the project in
early 2025. This gave us ample time to [design the perfect
engagement](/services/) and be very well prepared into the run-up. The brief was
simple: improve the user experience. The focus wasn’t on
[SEO](/2023/07/core-web-vitals-for-search-engine-optimisation/) or revenue, but
simply on improving the user experience. After all, improve UX, and all else
follows. It’s a wise move!

We decided to benchmark on [Core Web Vitals](/workshops/core-web-vitals-on-ios/)
as they’re arguably the most sensible place to start for a fledgling project.
Their biggest sticking points were Largest Contentful Paint and Cumulative
Layout Shift. Interaction to Next Paint wasn’t much of a concern for them as
they’d made smart decisions in the past and not gone all-in on JavaScript.

The project was to be incredibly tactical—a quick-fire round of specific
improvements built out into a backlog that the team could pick up as and when
they were ready. What was nice about this approach, and not running a big
reveal-style project, is that we were able to realise performance improvements
while the project was in flight. Not only was this highly motivating, it
demonstrated immediate value in the project. It was the right thing to do!

And how did it go? It went very well:

</figure>

As is customary, I handed over a full Trello backlog (half of which were already
live), and an Executive Summary document for the non-technical stakeholders and
sponsors.

It was about as targeted as a [web performance audit](/performance-audits/) can
get: in and out, job done.
