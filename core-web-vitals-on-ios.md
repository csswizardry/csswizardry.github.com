**Safari’s getting Core Web Vitals in 2025. Are you ready?**

<a href="/contact/" class="btn  btn--primary">Get Prepared</a>

When [Google announced Core Web Vitals were coming to Chrome in
2020](https://web.dev/articles/vitals#core-web-vitals), the web performance
industry was a frenzy! Everyone wanted to get their sites in shape, and it was
a great time for web performance.

Five years on, Core Web Vitals have worked! The web as an ecosystem has gotten
steadily faster across the board:

## Core Web Vitals on (Mobile) Safari

It’s important to view Core Web Vitals through two distinct lenses:

<img src="/img/content/core-web-vitals-ios/firefox-logo.png" alt="Firefox logo" width="128" height="128"
     style="float: right;
            margin-left: 24px;
            shape-outside: url(/img/content/core-web-vitals-ios/firefox-logo.png);" />

1. **[Core Web Vitals, the metrics](https://web.dev/articles/vitals):** Largest
   Contentful Paint, Interaction to Next Paint, and Cumulative Layout Shift.
   These metrics are platform agnostic and defined in a spec that any other
   browser is free to implement. [Firefox already
   has!](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1722322)
2. **[The Chrome User eXperience Report
   (CrUX)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux):** The public dataset used by
   Google as a ranking signal for SEO. This is specific only to Chrome, so any
   other browser—including Chrome on iOS!—is a blind spot.

These two points yield two corresponding problems…

1. Apple haven’t implemented any of the Core Web Vitals in their own browser,
   Safari, and;
2. Apple, until [iOS
   17.4](https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-browser-engines/),
   hasn’t allowed any non-WebKit browser engine on the iOS platform.

This means that we’ve had zero visibility of the Core Web Vitals metrics on iOS
or any flavour of Safari at all. If you’re based in [North
America](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america)
or northwestern Europe, that may mean **the majority of your audience is
completely unaccounted for**.

However, things are about to change.

## Core Web Vitals Come to Safari

Apple announced that Largest Contentful Paint and Interaction to Next Paint
would be coming to Safari as part of [the Interop 2025
project](https://webkit.org/blog/16458/announcing-interop-2025/)! This means
that we can begin tracking and instrumenting two of the three Core Web Vitals
before the end of the year!

## Are You Prepared?

If you’ve been focusing on Core Web Vitals for your Chrome visitors already,
you’re well poised. But are you prepared for what it might mean for the
business? Are your developers prepared for the different rendering engine? Do
you know how to track site-speed in Safari if the data doesn’t go into CrUX?

## Get the Workshop

To help prepare clients—both new and old—I’ve designed a one-day workshop
covering, but not limited to:

* **Apple, Safari, and Core Web Vitals**
  * Why can’t we get Core Web Vitals on iPhones?
  * Why can’t we get Core Web Vitals in Safari?
  * What even is Chrome on iOS?
* **Key events**
  * LCP is coming to Safari in 2025!
  * Blink can run on iOS as of 17.4 (but it still doesn’t)
* **What does Safari mean to you?**
  * Based on your own audience, how much does it matter to you?
  * Can we infer anything from existing Core Web Vitals data?
* **How does Safari differ from Chrome?**
  * WebKit vs. Blink
  * JavaScriptCore vs. V8
  * Performance API availability
  * Interop 2025
* **How do we measure Safari in the wild?**
  * If it’s not in CrUX, where is it?
  * Real user monitoring
  * Which metrics can we capture
* **Safari on localhost**
  * Safari-specific devtools
  * Tips, tricks, and workflows
  * Testing real devices

The goal is to leave the team aware of the upcoming changes, arm them with tools
and knowledge to optimise for the different engines, and ensure that your Safari
users aren’t being overlooked.

### Remote or In-Person

I much, much prefer in person workshops—it means we can hang out and probably
head for drinks after! But as it’s only a single day, running the workshop
remotely works pretty naturally. Remote workshops will be recorded for you to
keep.
