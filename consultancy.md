**Web performance affects all businesses. How does it affect yours?**

I work together with organisations of all sizes to analyse, find, and fix
site-speed issues. How much does a one-second slowdown affect conversion rates?
Are third party scripts impacting engagement? How does site-speed influence
revenues?

It’s my job to help you find out.

Consultancy engagements are designed for specific clients and projects, but they
all combine some or all of the following:

* **Analysis:** You can’t fix what you can’t measure. Let’s work out just how
  site-speed affects your business. Once we have an idea of exactly what web
  performance means for you, we’re far better equipped to make meaningful
  improvements.
* **Audits:** I’m a technical consultant at heart—I have a forensic knowledge of
  how both the network and web browsers work. My audits are famed for their
  extensive, detailed, yet actionable insights, and will uncover everything that
  is working against us.
* **Implementation:** Performance sprints are a highly effective way to realise
  returns _fast_. I’ll work alongside your engineering team to get
  customer-facing site-speed improvements out of the door and earning you money.
  I won’t just find the problems—I’ll fix them.
* **Culture:** You should never need to call pest control twice. I will ensure
  your team is left self-sufficient and able to tackle these issues themselves
  in future. Let’s build a performance culture that bakes site-speed
  considerations into projects from the outset. Let’s make it easy to do the
  right thing.

I pride myself on my ability to work with organisations, not merely for them. So
much so that I wrote [a book about
it](https://gumroad.com/l/questions-for-consultants).

## Consultations

For lighter-touch guidance and advice, we can schedule 90-minute consultations
to answer your most pressing questions: want to work out what a slow website is
costing your business? Need to know where you should you focus your efforts
first? Looking for help troubleshooting specific performance issues? Let’s get
your answers.

Consultations are a great idea if:

1. **you have a specific, distinct issue** that you don’t need a weeks-long
   consultancy project to solve;
2. **you want to start your site-speed journey more tentatively**, testing the
   water with a smaller commitment at the beginning.

If we go on to work together more fully after our initial consultation, it gets
discounted from your first consultancy invoice. Win-win, no risk!

<small>A consultation is not just a call—when you schedule a consultation, I’ll
ask you to provide me with any relevant research, homework, and tasks so that
I can fully prepare for our meeting. Want me to look over some waterfall charts?
You got it! Need me to debug some stuff? Send me a URL. Need a second opinion on
your Vitals? I’m on it!</small>
